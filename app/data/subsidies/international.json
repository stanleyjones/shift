   "MIGA Project 8092. Project description:  InfraCo has applied for MIGA guarantees of an aggregate amount of up to $127.9 million, for a period of up to 20 years, against the risk of breach of contract.\n\nThe Cape Verde Wind Farm Project comprises the development, construction, ownership, and operation of a wind farm in Cape Verde with approximately 28 MW installed capacity. The project will be one of the largest wind farms to be developed in Africa and a high-profile entry to the African renewable energy sector for potential investors. MIGA’s guarantee is being requested for €35 million of non-shareholder loans plus €17 million of interest and €23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus €22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\nEIB Project: \n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to Cabeólica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, São Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island. Each wind farm will include towers with wind turbines, transformers, a substation, a command centre, an underground transmission line and an access road.",

The project also includes a wide variety of small sub-projects to support the bigger technology platforms as well as the traditional business areas within the group; these projects mainly focus on nanotechnologies, sustainable re-use of construction materials and application of renewables to civil engineering. The promoter carries out his RDI program in dedicated technology centres located in Spain (Madrid, Pamplona and Barcelona).\n\nObjectives\n\nAccording to the Commission's latest Competitiveness Report, investments in Research and Development (R&D) contribute significantly to increases in productivity. Private sector investments meet the orientations that underpin the Lisbon’s Council decision as “increased investment in R&D can significantly increase productivity growth, especially if the elements of the knowledge triangle, R&D, innovation, education and training, are well integrated, including the provision of scientific personnel”. The promoter’s RDI programme covers a wide range of projects in its majority related to renewable energies. The development of wind power, solar and biomass derived energy is one of the priorities of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan). Part of the project also focuses on water treatment with objectives in line with the ones of the European Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform (WSSTP).",

Project description:  InfraCo has applied for MIGA guarantees of an aggregate amount of up to $127.9 million, for a period of up to 20 years, against the risk of breach of contract.\n\nThe Cape Verde Wind Farm Project comprises the development, construction, ownership, and operation of a wind farm in Cape Verde with approximately 28 MW installed capacity. The project will be one of the largest wind farms to be developed in Africa and a high-profile entry to the African renewable energy sector for potential investors. MIGA’s guarantee is being requested for €35 million of non-shareholder loans plus €17 million of interest and €23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus €22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\nEIB Project: \n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to Cabeólica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, São Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island. Each wind farm will include towers with wind turbines, transformers, a substation, a command centre, an underground transmission line and an access road.",

   "2.\tUnder this project, a wind farm will be constructed having a total output of 220 MW(some three times larger than the Shin Izumo Wind Farm, the largest in Japan with a total output of 78 MW) in the Gulf of El Zayt region along the Red Sea coast, located 350 kilometers southeast of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. In addition to meeting an increase in demand for power, this project will contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gases through the use of renewable energy in place of fossil fuels, supporting both Egypt’s economic development and preservation of the global environment.\n\n3.\tThe Gulf of El Zayt region is a suitable area for one of the most prominent wind farms in the world with stable wind direction and wind speed averaging at least 10 meters per second though the year. The wind farm to be built using this loan will be the largest ever in Egypt. This project will result in an increase of approximately one percent of the total power production capacity in Egypt, and will curb carbon dioxide emissions by 494,000 tons per year as compared to an equivalent quantity of power produced with fossil fuels. Preparations are being made for developing this project under the post-Kyoto international framework as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project. [1]",

   "10994  On August 10, 2012, MIGA issued guarantees of $16.3 million to Globeleq Mesoamérica Energy (Wind) Limited of Bermuda to cover its equity investment in Eolo Wind Farm in Nicaragua. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.\nThe Eolo project involves the construction of a 44 megawatt wind farm in Rivas Province on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. Eolo consists of 22 Gamesa G90 2 megawatt wind turbine generators, as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generators to a high-voltage substation. It is estimated that Eolo will be able to generate approximately 169.6 gigawatt hours of electricity per year, without requiring any fossil fuel supply. The wind farm is expected to start operations by December of 2012 and the electricity will be purchased by local distribution companies Distribuidora de Electricidad del Norte, S.A. (Disnorte) and Distribuidora de Electricidad del Sur, S.A. (Dissur).\nNicaragua’s electrification rate is among the lowest in Central America. Additionally, reliance on thermal (oil-fired) generating plants has made the long-term marginal costs the highest in the region. This project aims to provide additional generation capacity that is not only renewable and clean, but also helps reduce the average marginal cost of generation, resulting in an overall reduced cost of electricity to users.\nMIGA’s participation in the project is aligned with the agency’s commitment to support investment into into countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association and investment in infrastructure.",

   "The main objective of the lOMW Uruguay Wind Farm Project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by grid-connected electricity generation from wind power. The emissions reduction will arise from the displacement of fossil-fuel-based electricity generation on the national grid. The project will contribute to the sustainable development of Uruguay, most notably through energy security and the substitution of crude oil and derivatives imports. This project being the first of its kind, it is designed as a small-scale pilot, aimed at being easily replicated in case of success. UTE had to improve several tranches for ways to gain access to the area of the highest peak where the wind farm is located. This led to temporary impacts, which were duly compensated, associated with rehabilitation work. Also duly compensated was permanent damage caused to fences or other assets as a result of road rehabilitation or installation of transmission poles.",

The project would encompass new public, private and community based delivery models for both grid and off-grid technologies and would consist of the following three components: on-grid rural electrification, the National Rural Electrification Strategy study has identified 27 service territories in twelve governorates for rural electric service expansion and integration into the national grid. The second component is the off-grid electrification, this component would provide electricity service to off grid areas based on SHS. The areas of focus will be the fringe areas of the twelve selected service territories that are on-grid extensions and areas outside the service territories in the seven governorates which have been defined as off-grid areas. The grid and the off-grid programs will broadly follow common principles with respect to technical quality, service standards and organizational principles. The third component is the institutional support and technical assistance, key items to be addressed through this component include: (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of the agencies responsible for carrying out the on-grid and the off-grid rural electrification delivery services; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity; (iii) supporting the establishment and initial operation of the eligible Rural Electricity Service Providers (RESP) within the project area; (iv) designing and implementing a tariff framework that will ensure the financial sustainability of the eligible RESPs; (v) provision of support to the Project Management Unit; (vi) preparation of studies on rural energy with particular emphasis on renewable energy; and (vii) developing a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply strategy to improve access to LPG among the rural population.\n\nIDA $25 mill; African Development Bank 47.1 mill;  Islamic Development Bank - Al Aqsa Fund  25.4 mill; German Development Service 3.5 mill",

A review of the technologies and the sites would need to be undertaken and technical support for the bid processing preparation has been requested. In addition, a team from MNRE has been setup to coordinate on the pilot projects. This team would visit operational sites for such new technology to confirm operability and assess viability under Indian conditions. In addition, MNRE would need to develop environmental guidelines for solar projects (including disposal issues). Support for development of such guidelines based on international best practices and national policies would be required.",

The project has following two components: (1) sunshine schools program support - installation of 100 megawatt (MW) rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Beijing. This component will install 100 MW of distributed rooftop PV systems in about 800 schools and other educational institutions in Beijing under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model for large-scale rooftop solar PV deployment. Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality",

The project would encompass new public, private and community based delivery models for both grid and off-grid technologies and would consist of the following three components: on-grid rural electrification, the National Rural Electrification Strategy study has identified 27 service territories in twelve governorates for rural electric service expansion and integration into the national grid. The second component is the off-grid electrification, this component would provide electricity service to off grid areas based on SHS. The areas of focus will be the fringe areas of the twelve selected service territories that are on-grid extensions and areas outside the service territories in the seven governorates which have been defined as off-grid areas. The grid and the off-grid programs will broadly follow common principles with respect to technical quality, service standards and organizational principles. The third component is the institutional support and technical assistance, key items to be addressed through this component include: (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of the agencies responsible for carrying out the on-grid and the off-grid rural electrification delivery services; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity; (iii) supporting the establishment and initial operation of the eligible Rural Electricity Service Providers (RESP) within the project area; (iv) designing and implementing a tariff framework that will ensure the financial sustainability of the eligible RESPs; (v) provision of support to the Project Management Unit; (vi) preparation of studies on rural energy with particular emphasis on renewable energy; and (vii) developing a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply strategy to improve access to LPG among the rural population.\n\nIDA $25 mill; African Development Bank 47.1 mill;  Islamic Development Bank - Al Aqsa Fund  25.4 mill; German Development Service 3.5 mill",

The Project includes the construction of a 2.8 km-long transmission line. Aura is being developed by Gauss Energía (“Gauss”), an independent Mexican energy consultancy/developer and will be 100% owned by Corporacion Aura Solar, (“CAS”). The Project will be constructed and operated under an EPC contract with an experienced engineering firm and PV panels will be supplied by a top-class PV manufacturer. Construction will last approximately 8 months and Aura is expected to be commissioned by August 2013.  Mexican sole power utility CFE will act as off-taker of the Project under a 20-year  take-and-pay and will pay Aura Solar the applicable Short Term Marginal Cost or “Costo Total de Corto Plazo” at the La Paz node. Aura is the first private utility scale project to be developed under this framework and the largest PV solar plant to be built to date in Mexico. \n \nThe Project will contribute to increase the share of clean and renewable energy in Mexico, specifically in BCS, an area mainly powered by fossil fuel generation. \n \nThe Project will contribute an additional 30 MW towards Mexico's stated target of achieving at least 35% penetration of renewable energy and other \"clean\" power generation sources in its energy matrix by 2025. Given its location in Baja California Sur (BCS) and the State's current energy matrix, the Project will substitute the carbon-intensive HFO and diesel -fired power generation delivered to approx 160,0000 inhabitants with a clean, renewable energy source, and will displace approx. 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. \n\nBy reducing the reliance on imports of fossil fuels to BCS, the Project is also expected to significantly reduce environmental risks associated with transporting such fossil fuels through environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Sea of Cortez . In addition, the Project is estimated to generate approx. 150-200 direct-employment positions during its construction period.",

This Project is based on the Feasibility study conducted by JICA from February to November 2009 upon a request from the Maldivian Government to the Japanese Government.\n\nThe Grant Aid of 1 Billion yen for the project was signed by by H.E. Ali Hussain Didi High Commissioner of Maldives in Sri Lanka and by Mr. Akira Shimura, Chief Representative of JICA, Sri Lanka Office at the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka on 25th March 2010 based on the Exchange of Notes signed by H.E. Kunio Takahashi, Ambassador of Japan to the Republic of Maldives and by H.E. Ali Hussain Didi.\n\nThe objective of the Project is to promote the utilization of solar energy as an alternate and renewable resource of energy and undertake adaptation measures against climate change by reducing Green House Gases as planned in the Government 7th National Development Plan (2006-2010). The Project would also contribute to the Maldivian Government’s Strategic Action Plan as well as her policy of becoming a Carbon Neutrality Country by 2020.\n\n\nUnder the project the Ministry of Housing, Transportation and Environment will undertake to install Solar Panels in 5 selected locations in Male’ such as the President's Office, Maldives Center for Social Education (MCSE), STELCO, Thaajuddeen School and Hiriyaa School for the generation of 400 KWh of Solar Power (Thaajuddeen School was reconstructed in March 2004 and Hiriyaa School was constructed in March 2009 under the Japanese grant aid project). The project for Clean Energy promotion in Male' will be expected to complete in October 2011.\n\nJICA is the bilateral donor agency contributing to the economic and social development of Maldives through an on-going Japanese ODA Loan project for the rehabilitation of 7 islands' harbors, 3 islands' sewerage facilities, and on-going technical cooperation project for the capacity development of MHTE in the field of sewerage system, and dispatching 22 Japanese Volunteers as of March 2010.",

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is subsidies for solar PV systems. The project will fund output-based subsidies to private dealers for the sale, installation, and after-sale service for solar home systems of different sizes for rural households. The second component of the project is the transaction support. It is worth noting that the provision of technical assistance is consistent with emerging practices for off-grid electrification, which indicate that successful off-grid electrification projects require substantial accompanying technical assistance resources, both for the transaction and supervision, given that: (i) these are nascent markets, and (ii) governments typically lack experience and capacity to oversee these new transactions. The third component of the project is the project supervision by the Bank. Project supervision covers the work of the task team leader, the technical specialists, and the fiduciary and safeguards staff for the supervision of the Global Partnership Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) subsidies.",

The new grant, signed on March 2, 2011, is in addition to a grant of US$7.2 million approved last year, bringing GPOBA’s funding commitment for this project to about US$14 million. The new funds mean an additional 175,000 households in rural areas of Bangladesh will be able to install individual Solar Home Systems (SHS). The GPOBA financing is a boost to the on-going Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy (RERED) project that supports the SHS program in Bangladesh, which is considered to be one of the most successful SHS programs in the world.

The project also includes a wide variety of small sub-projects to support the bigger technology platforms as well as the traditional business areas within the group; these projects mainly focus on nanotechnologies, sustainable re-use of construction materials and application of renewables to civil engineering. The promoter carries out his RDI program in dedicated technology centres located in Spain (Madrid, Pamplona and Barcelona).\n\nObjectives\n\nAccording to the Commission's latest Competitiveness Report, investments in Research and Development (R&D) contribute significantly to increases in productivity. Private sector investments meet the orientations that underpin the Lisbon’s Council decision as “increased investment in R&D can significantly increase productivity growth, especially if the elements of the knowledge triangle, R&D, innovation, education and training, are well integrated, including the provision of scientific personnel”. The promoter’s RDI programme covers a wide range of projects in its majority related to renewable energies. The development of wind power, solar and biomass derived energy is one of the priorities of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan). Part of the project also focuses on water treatment with objectives in line with the ones of the European Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform (WSSTP).",

The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources will be the implementing agency of the grants.\n\nPart of the proceeds will be applied for technical assistance in the establishment of the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (Jordan REEF). The establishment of Jordan REEF is based on articles (11-15) of the Jordan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law, which came into force in February 2010. The Jordan REEF was designed in an extensive World Bank supported study and is the main instrument of the government for promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency investments. The main goal of the Fund is to raise awareness of energy savings potential among industry, commercial and household consumers and provide technical and financial support to overcome existing investment barriers. The Fund will channel financial support provided by international donors and the Government of Jordan and set up different windows for renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) projects. These may, eventually, include a RE Subsidy window, a RE and EE Guarantee window, a Studies and Technical Cooperation window, a RE and EE Interest Rate Subsidy window and an Equity Window.",

In addition, the project, Hydro Fodder Farm, will organize and empower beneficiaries to manage fodder production and distribution on a sustainable basis. The beneficiaries will also be involved in evaluating the implemented project’s impacts. The project anticipates a 20 percent increase in peak and total milk yield during a lactation period, a 25 percent increase in the birth weight of newborn calves, and a 20 percent increase in beneficiaries’ overall income.\nRATIONALE: The severe lack of green fodder is a major constraint in improving the productivity of India’s livestock. Little area is under fodder cultivation. Seasonal rainfall, and degradation of grazing land and common property resources are all limiting factors to green fodder availability. Over 70 percent of the milk is produced by small to medium-size farms worked by marginal farmers and agrocultural\nlaborers? The drastic drop in milk production during summer months adversely impacts the livelihoods of\nlarge number of poor populations. Hydro Fodder Farm, using 300 square feet of wasteland innovative greenhouses (employing hydroponics) will b dedicated to fodder production and will serve as a viable alternative in areas with land and water shortages\nINNOVATION: The project adopts a new approach to green fodder production, using solar- and windpowered\ngreenhouses with new technology, enables year-round availability of nutrient-, mineral-, and enzyme-rich green fodder of consistent quality and quantity, produced with the most efficient use of water and other natural resources.",

This will be done in partnership with UNIDO and its Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, which is also supported by the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE). The Regional Observatory serves a tested model in the region for this type of work and IDB support to its activities will help consolidate what The Regional Observatory has managed to develop in the 11 above-mentioned countries. In addition to supporting new activities in The Regional Observatory, the support of this TC will also contribute to expanding The Regional Observatory¿s reach to an additional 15 LAC countries (Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, and Venezuela) allowing it to eventually operate in all 26 IDB Member-countries. The additionality of this TC is its ability to produce the transparency and knowledge of each country specific market that is needed to spur investment at a level that makes a significant impact improving the energy security of the region. The three studies to be funded by this TC will accomplish this at a level not before seen in renewable energy research in the LAC region. This TC is therefore primarily linked to the UNIDO¿s Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, but will be executed in close coordination with another relevant UN initiative: the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative . Both are initiatives where the IDB has publically committed to supporting LAC efforts in renewables, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. The information generated from these three studies directly supports both of these initiatives; the measurements and data provided by the studies will be essential to better prioritizing technologies per country, which projects to support, their funding and how much, and even identifying knowledge gaps, and this holds true for our work internally at the IDB as well as for those actors in each of the countries being studied where this information will be shared through regional workshops. Specifically this TC will also help projects that are in the planning stages or already approved by providing the most up-to-date financial information thus improving or confirming the financial structure of projects such as wind power generation projects in Mexico or the financial scenario of solar projects in Chile. In short, this TC is intended to provide essential market analysis that pushes forward the region's work in three areas: renewables energy, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. This TC is consistent with the Bank¿s GCI-9 sector priorities because helping increase the market penetration of renewable energy will contribute to an increase in the use of sustainable energy, the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and toward a reduction in poverty.",

   "IBRD/IDA Project ID: P115426.  Energy Efficiency Development Policy Loan. The Government of Poland faces a dilemma: how can it decrease harmful emissions, while maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with the European Union (EU)-15 and do this within a constrained fiscal environment. The World Bank (the Bank) worked closely with the Government during 2009-10 to address this conundrum in preparing the 2011 report \"Transition to a low emissions economy in Poland,\"  analyzing the carbon abatement potential in Poland and the associated economic impact. The analysis identified energy efficiency and selected renewable energy investments as the priority near- to medium-term investments. Although energy efficiency options are low cost, market penetration has been limited. This DPL supports policy actions that are designed to address market rigidities. Poland faces a problem in achieving bold renewable energy targets as there is little hydropower or deep geothermal potential and solar power is expensive. Biomass applications have recently shown promise and are, along with wind power and biogas, expected to be the focus of attention in meeting Poland's 2020 renewable energy target of 15.0 percent of final energy consumption from renewable energy sources. To support the implementation of its renewable energy policy, the government has established a green certificates program that obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of renewable energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies are available from EC funds used to help decrease renewable energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions. The total cost of this project is $1,114,500,000.  (Renewable energy 17% - Biomass and windpower).",

The second component is the access scale-up. Access scale-up includes intensification of connections to the households and villages in the areas already connected by the grid. The access scale-up will address the low connection intensity in the areas with grid access. The project will finance the materials and equipment required for the last-mile connectivity. The third component is the market development for renewable energy and energy efficient products. Development of stand-alone renewable energy programs such as solar home systems (SHSs), solar lanterns, improved cook-stoves, biogas plants, and similar activities will provide additional coverage for household access to energy (modern lighting, efficient cooking, etc.), especially in areas that are not yet connected to the grid. The target beneficiaries for this component will be the households and villages that are either outside the reach of the electricity grid as well as those that are in the electricity grid area but are unable to afford the connection to electricity services and the associated usage fees (through the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency products). Finally, the fourth component is the modernization support.\n\nTotal project cost: $275 million; $200 million IDA, 75% Transmission/distribution; 20% Renewables",

The improved quality and availability of electricity supply will make it possible for KPLC and the Rural Electricity Agency (REA) to extend power to new areas thus allowing more consumers to be connected. Moreover, KPLC will reduce the losses on its system thus eliminating the need for immediate investment in the generation facilities.",

To optimize transnational power supply and promote country-wide power transfer in an efficient manner, the Government aims to integrate regional power grid network systems, which comprise five interconnected electrical regions including northern, north-eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region attempts to connect and synchronize power system of neighboring states within the region, but interregional power transfer capacity has still been limited. Since natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in certain locations, surplus power from some regions can be transferred to other regions in power deficit only when creating transmission super highways among the regions. While the existing interregional transmission capacity stands at 22,400 MW, the Government targets to increase this capacity to 27,950 MW by 2012, growing to 57,000 MW by 2015, and 75,000 MW by 2017 under the 12th Five Year Plan.

Subsequently, on 28 March 2008, ADB approved the MFF of an aggregate amount of $600 million to POWERGRID for the Investment Program. Initially, the scope of the program comprised of two projects; Project 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity for Evacuation of Power from Uttarakhand, and Project 2: ?800 kV High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Northeastern Northern/Western Interconnector. However, due to the delay in commissioning of the associated hydropower generating facilities in Uttarakhand, POWERGRID decided to keep on hold the implementation of Project 1 until 2013. As a result, it was decided that all ADB facility of $600 million under the MFF will be utilized to fund Project 2: +800kV HVDC North East - Northern/Western Interconnector in two tranches. Loan Agreements for Tranche 1 (Loan No. 2415-IND: $400 million) and Tranche 2 (Loan No. 2510-IND: $ 200 million) were signed on 28 March 2008 and 27 March 2009, respectively. Current completion dates for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are 30 June 2013, and 30 June 2014, respectively. All contracts under Tranche 1 ($388 million approx.) and Tranche 2 ($119 million approx.) have been awarded in 2010. Based on the contract award, the loan savings of $76 million was confirmed. ADB received the Periodic Financing Request (PFR) for Tranche 3 for an amount of $76 million under the MFF on 21 June 2011 (Appendix 1). The investments under Tranche 3 will cover part of the POWERGRID investment plan under its Transmission Sector Road Map.",

This mixed rural distribution network faces several problems: the overuse of subsidized electricity for agricultural water pumping leaves households with an inadequate power supply, and the unauthorized use of electricity causes the DISCOMs to suffer financial losses. Aging and overloaded distribution lines and transformers result in excessive technical losses and poor quality power. To prevent the overuse of electricity by agricultural pumps and to reduce losses, the DISCOMs switch on the distribution lines serving the rural areas for a limited number of hours per day. The existing mixed-feeder system does not allow power to be supplied on a 24-hour basis to households and business establishments, constraining economic growth and development in rural areas. To promote efficient use of groundwater in agriculture and improve on-farm water conservation practices, the DISCOMs supply 3-phase electricity in rural areas for 8 10 hours daily. However, this constraints economic activities and the constant (24-hour) supply of quality power to households. Attempted supply of one phase power, after 8 10-hour supply of three phase power, to reduce overuse of power by irrigation pumps by the DISCOMs was not effective. Separation of power supply lines (feeders) to agriculture and other customers is necessary to ensure the 24-hour supply of power to households. Additional measures such as installation of a HVDS and metering, together with better system management practices are necessary to reduce DISCOMs technical and commercial losses.",

Mali still has a very low rural electrification access rate. According to the National Directorate of Energy (DNE), in 2007 only about 17 percent of the population has access to electricity. In urban areas the access rate is about 30 percent and it is about 7 percent in rural areas. These low access rates are not allowing Mali to fully harness its economic potentials to compete fairly on international markets. Most rural households meet their lighting and small power needs with kerosene, dry cell, and car batteries. They do not have any form of modern energy for lighting or for operating equipment. This additional financing is intended to mainly finance energy services delivery sub-projects (both bottom up and top down) consistent with its initial development objective. The successful experience of the spontaneous bottom up projects under HEURA has demonstrated the potential for energy services delivery schemes in rural Mali led by local private operators. This experience needs to be sustained by adequate and predictable financing to avoid loosing the momentum created. The bottom up rural electrification approach needs to be complemented by large scale projects which have greater scaling up potential in the sense that they can deliver the majority of connections in the long run.",

Nepal’s total grid-connected generation capacity amounts to a meager 698 MW (with actual available capacity at any moment considerably less) and, with a peak demand of about 885 MW, the supply-demand gap has grown sharply in recent years. Load-shedding (rationing of\nelectricity to grid-connected consumers) has long been a facet of the hydro-dependent power system in Nepal, where protracted conflict and weak institutions and finances have discouraged investment and hampered the addition of generation capacity. Moreover, the Nepal power Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized system lacks adequate storage to capture the wet season surplus water that could be used to boost generation in the dry season.

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR17.20 million (equivalent of approximately US$27.88 million) to the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project. This additional financing will not entail restructuring of any of the project's components or its implementation arrangements. The current project development objective will remain unchanged and the current closing date will not be extended. The incurred delays under the on-grid part required some necessary changes to the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators. However those changes only relate to a rescheduling of the targets into future years. All activities could be implemented and targets achieved as per the original target values by the current project closing date of March 2015, recently extended because certain on-grid targets would not have been achievable in the original time frame of the project. The results framework was already updated in this regard during the midterm review of December 2010 and reviewed by and agreed with the Bank. The applicability of this updated results framework was reconfirmed during appraisal by the Bank and the borrower including validity of all its indicator values and targets.

   "31482  Butec is a mid-size family-owned Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor based in Beirut, Lebanon, and a current IFC client. Butec established a new company - Butec Utility Services (BUS) - which has been awarded a four year Power Distribution Service Provider (DSP) contract for the Northern Lebanon region serving 350,000 households. BUS, to be majority owned by Butec, will execute the DSP contract along with several partners experienced in Power Distribution. Butec’s partners on this project, including ERDF (the wholly owned distribution subsidiary of Électricité de France), El-Sewedy (Egypt) and AT Kearney, have a track record of successful projects in countries facing similar challenges. Butec has approached IFC to provide financing for BUS.\n\n1. Support the reform of the power sector: IFC's strategy for Lebanon is to help the government put the country's economy on a path of sustained, high, and broad-based economic growth. An investment in a DSP as a first step towards reform has the potential to address that.\n 2. Promoting private sector participation: The DSP contracts are a step towards greater private participation in the power sector in Lebanon, one that fits well within the IFC's strategy for Lebanon.\n 3. Decrease distribution network losses: one of the main incentives behind outsourcing the operations and maintenance of the distribution network and the installation of a network of smart meters is the minimization of losses, technical and non-technical. An investment in Butec will help decrease these losses and improve the efficiency of the network.\n 5. Higher quality of service: upgrading the distribution network, while decreasing the losses, will increase the quality of service to the customers through wider access to the network and/or shorter load shedding periods.",

Bartrac Equipment is a joint venture between two Caterpillar dealers operating in Africa, Barloworld Equipment and Tractafric Equipment. MIGA’s guarantee is for up to 10 years and covers the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation.\n\nThe project involves the establishment of a dealership in the Katanga province of the DRC for the distribution and servicing of Caterpillar earth-moving and power generating equipment. The project will directly supply equipment suitable for the construction and rehabilitation of road and rail links, office and residential buildings, and power sector installations in the Katanga province. An office block, workshop facilities, and spare parts warehouse will be set up at Lubumbashi, provincial capital of Katanga Province, and Kolwezi, a mining town.\n\nThe project is designed to indirectly address the infrastructure needs of the DRC, which is in a very poor state following decades of conflicts and economic and political instability. The earth-moving equipment will help build the country's road network and tackle one of its biggest challenges—traveling between provinces. Increased availability of earth-moving equipment and maintenance services will help enhance efficiency and productivity in the mining sector, and is expected to encourage downstream growth.",

Before the earthquake of January 2010, the energy sector in Haiti had a number of weaknesses and existed in a state of crisis which directly affected the economic activity and living standards of the Haitian population. These weaknesses include: (i) dependence on fossil fuels for primary electricity generation; (ii) limited availability and access to electricity; (iii) significant technical and commercial energy losses; and (iv) dependence on fuel wood and charcoal, mainly used for cooking, which causes deforestation. The earthquake has exacerbated this situation and created an urgent need for a long term energy strategy that integrates short term reconstruction measures with long term goals. In 2007 the Ministry of Public Works Transport and Telecommunications, with the technical assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, produced the Haiti National Energy Sector Development Plan (NESDP). The NESDP included a comprehensive diagnosis of Haiti's energy sector in 2007, identified the key issues that needed to be addressed and proposed actions for the development of the energy sector from 2007 to 2017. This study will be taken as a starting point for the development of an energy strategy, however, it must be reassessed, reformulated and expanded, in order to take into account the impacts of the earthquake on Haiti's energy sector. Such impacts include key issues like migration to the urban areas, the shift of demand centers due to migration patterns, the reconstruction of housing infrastructure, and the opportunities offered by new technologies that can be employed in the energy sector.Consequently, the objective of this KCP is to help the Government of Haiti identify and develop a comprehensive strategy for the energy sector. This strategy will consider not only the immediate and short term measures that need to be taken to rebuild the energy sector after the earthquake, but also the medium and long term actions and reforms that could lead Haiti's energy sector toward a more efficient and sustainable system that is commercially viable, has a more diverse energy matrix and a greater service coverage.

This component will be managed by Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM) and includes the two sub-components. \t\nJamaica/WB: Consumers to Benefit from Energy Efficiency Programme\nPress Release No:2011/364/LAC\n\nWASHINGTON, March 10, 2011 — Virtually the entire population of Jamaica of 2.7 million people will benefit as a result of a US$15 million loan approved today by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank to increase energy efficiency and security on the island.\n\nThe loan will benefit Jamaica’s residential, commercial and industrial energy consumers through the development of detailed policies and plans on renewable energy to reduce the country’s high dependence on imported petroleum products while moving to cleaner fuels.\n\n“Given the current crisis in energy worldwide, this World Bank loan program is very well timed. It presents a way forward for the country in attacking the serious issue of energy inefficiency, and, along with other complementary projects, will allow us in a relatively short time to become a more productive nation,” stated Hillary Alexander, Permanent Secretary in Jamaica’s Ministry of Energy and Mining.\n\nThe Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project will contribute to reduced energy costs, increased energy security and improved economic competitiveness. It also supports efforts to address climate change by contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“The World Bank recognizes that addressing Jamaica’s energy needs is crucial for the country to stimulate economic growth and competitiveness. We are pleased that this project supports Jamaica’s policy objectives of promoting energy conservation and efficiency and ensuring energy security,” said Françoise Clottes, World Bank Director for the Caribbean.\n\nSome specific activities which the project will support include: (A) Developing detailed policies, strategies and implementation plans on renewable energy (in particular hydro, wind and biomass), energy efficiency and gas, and on related regulations. (B) Strengthening the regulatory framework for private-public partnership monitoring of the energy sector by building capacity in the Ministry of Energy and Mining and the Office of Utilities Regulation. (C) Introducing the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) program to support off-oil diversification. (D) Expanding the energy efficiency testing and labeling capability and information program of Jamaica’s Bureau of Standards. (E) Promoting solar and wind energy.\n(F) Providing a line of credit/revolving facility through the Development Bank of Jamaica to provide retail financing to the private sector for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments.

The GoV is implementing an ambitious power sector reform program to meet demand in a sustainable manner, deliver reliable and good quality electricity supply to support economic growth, while ensuring reasonable and fair revenues to investors and efficient and transparent costs to consumers. The expected outcomes of the reform program are the strengthening of electricity supply security and moving to efficient and competitive electricity prices. These outcomes are to be achieved through attracting a broader range of participants to invest in and modernize the management and operation of the electricity industry; and through the transition to electricity tariffs that, on the supply side, enable the financial viability of efficiently managed and operated companies, and on the demand side, provide pricing signals for the efficient use of electricity.",

Minas Gerais is the largest national producer of steel and iron, responsible for 60 percent of the national production. The State has 62 pig iron mills to supply the sector. Many of these mills use charcoal for energy and as thermo-reducing agent. However, most of the charcoal originates\nfrom illegal deforestation of the Cerrado biome (a mosaic of dry forests to savanna woodland). To deal with this issue, the GoMG passed the Law 18365/09, which virtually bans the use of charcoal from deforestation by 2018, as at least 95 percent charcoal consumed in the State must come from managed plantations. A key challenge, however, is that tree planting needs to start soon to meet the demand in 2018. The risk is that in response to this\nlaw, the industry could decide to use coal instead of the charcoal from deforestation, increasing the State's Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The State Government is concerned about this possibility and entered in a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank and the German Development Agency KfW in 2010 to develop alternatives to promote tree plantations for charcoal. A key Government objective is to create incentives and conditions for this law to be followed as originally intended, leading to a reduction of GHG emissions.",

The scope of this component will include all tasks required to complete the preparation of the selected subprojects so that their implementation can commence as soon as investment financing is available. The second component is the project preparation facility support and capacity building.

The grant for NSP III will help the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) to launch the third phase of the National Solidarity Program that is designed to: (a) continue to build and strengthen the capacity of Community Development Councils (CDCs) as key institutions to facilitate local development, service delivery and local governance; (b) support the continued program roll-out to an additional 10,320 rural communities; and (c) scale up program support to 17,400 rural communities for economic and social development schemes through provision of repeater grants to CDCs. NSP is one of the flagship development programs of the GoIRA. The project will continue the World Bank's support for NSP as part of the overall donor effort. The program builds on the lessons learned from the first and second phases of project implementation and addresses challenges to move the program forward. Donor funding support for the NSP has been largely channeled through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) with some additional support from bilateral donors.

The grant is a single-tranche operation supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake. First, the operation supports the implementation of the Government Action Plan for National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the international community in March 2010, aimed at rebuilding the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on decentralization presents economic and social reforms as well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports the government's program for enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction process. The Government Action Plan and governance program are in line with the strategy contained in the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for the period 2008-2010, of which one pillar aims at strengthening state capacity and management of public resources.

The objective of the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC VI) for Cape Verde is to support the policy reforms and institutional development necessary to foster sustained economic growth. The Government of Cape Verde (GOCV) has made considerable progress in achieving its reform objectives under both the current and previous PRSC series and has completed all PRSC benchmarks. Additionally, the government has met all assessment criteria for the final review of its International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Cape Verde has built a solid reputation for good governance and responsible fiscal policy: it ranks first in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the Africa Region (Low Income Countries). From 2000 to 2008 the Cape Verdean economy enjoyed an average annual real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5 percent. In 2007 Cape Verde graduated to Middle-Income Country (MIC) status. According to the analysis that underpins the proposed PRSC VI; fiscal deficits are expected to remain high through 2012. These are largely the joint result of adverse external conditions and the temporary acceleration of public investment which reflects the strategy to take advantage of the five-year window under which the government can still tap concessional sources of financing, following Cape Verde's graduation to MIC status. As the global economy, and the Euro Zone in particular, recovers from its current recession, the Cape Verdean economy should return to a robust growth path, and, in this context, the government's long-term macroeconomic stance remains adequate. The current PRSC VI will enable the government to maintain fiscal sustainability and continue its investment program without curtailing social services or accumulating an unsustainable debt burden.

It adopts policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support, Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support continued reforms in health and the implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature partnership between international partners and Rwanda. Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been implemented since 2008.

The expected outcomes of the reform program are the strengthening of electricity supply security and moving to efficient and competitive electricity prices. These outcomes are to be achieved through attracting a broader range of participants to invest in and modernize the management and operation of the electricity industry; and through the transition to electricity tariffs that, on the supply side, enable the financial viability of efficiently managed and operated companies, and on the demand side, provide pricing signals for the efficient use of electricity.",

This component for US$20 million will assist the government of Kenya (GoK) in ensuring that the first projects to come before the PPP Steering Committee (PPPSC) and PPP Secretariat (PPPS) are well-prepared, 'bankable,' and take into account lessons learned from previous PPP projects, the privatization program in Kenya, and regional and international experience. The third component of the project is improvements to Fiscal Commitment and Contingent Liability (FCCL) risk management framework. This component for US$5 million will provide support and guidance to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and other relevant agencies on the fiscal commitment and risk framework associated with infrastructure, with an emphasis on contingent liabilities from PPPs. The fourth component of the project is support for program management. This component for US$3.5 million may include equipment, operating costs, organizational and systems development, training, capacity building and technical assistance.\n\nWB: 10% for general energy sector",

The Government and SENELEC are also moving ahead with additional private investment in power generation, including three new independent power projects totaling about 450 MW, one of which to be supported by the World Bank Group (a dual HFO/gas 70 MW plant), as well as with further regional integration – in particular to benefit from the sub-region hydropower resources and Mauritania’s natural gas resources.  By the closing date of the proposed GGSC series, Senegal expects to achieve the following results related to the GGSC I prior actions: The undistributed energy due to load shedding decreases from 250 GWH in 2011 to 10\nGWH in 2015. The Government subsidies to the energy Sector decrease from CFAF99 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) in 2012 to CFAF50 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) in 2015.

(Agent bank), Mizuho \nCorporate Bank, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the Ibaragi Bank, Ltd.  JBIC also provided a \nguarantee for their cofinancing portions.  To encourage larger private sector financing, a mechanism was embedded \nin this loan package for transferring part of the loan asset of JBIC to cofinancing banks if they so wish in the future. \n \n2. This loan supports the Power Sector Development Program being implemented by the Philippine government under \nthe Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) legislated in June 2001.*1  It was also cofinanced with the Power \nSector Development Program Loan for which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a loan agreement with the \nPhilippine government in December 2006.  In cooperation with ADB, the progress in the implementation of the \nprogram will be monitored and assessed to ensure that power sector reform will proceed smoothly.  \n \n3. The power sector reform supported by this loan is pushing forward privatization of the state-owned National Power \nCorporation (NPC), introduction of a Wholesale Electricity Spot Market and generation projects by Independent \nPower Producer (IPP).  It is thus expected to (1) improve the business environment of about 500 Japanese affiliates \nand subsidiaries operating in the country with a stable supply of electric power; and (2) increase business \nopportunities for Japanese firms by enabling them to increase their participation in power generation projects and \nexport power-related equipment. \n \n \n*1 The key components of the Power Sector Development Program are: (1) Accelerating the sale of NPC's power generation assets; (2) \nImproving the financial viability of the NPC and the power sector; (3) Increasing the credit standing of power distribution companies; (4) \nDrafting the schedule for the liberalization of electricity markets; and (5) Ensuring stable supplies of power into the future.  An array of \nmeasures will be prepared and implemented in these five areas by the end of 2009.",

   "Background and Necessity\n\nSince the implementation of the doi moi reform policy in 1986, Vietnam has maintained rapid economic growth, which has brought an increase in the demand for energy demand (end use of consumption). Meanwhile in the energy field, the volume of greenhouse gases being emitted is rising such that Vietnam has the highest rate of average emission increase among major Asian nations between 1990 and 2006. Developing renewable energy and promoting its use, promoting energy conservation, implementing controls to decrease forestland loss and other such measures are thus urgently needed to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWith a particularly long coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, that includes the extensive delta regions, Vietnam stands to be among the nations most impacted by climate change. Should the sea level rise by one meter, for example, some 11 percent of Vietnam’s population will be adversely affected and the nation’s gross domestic product is forecast to drop by about 10 percent. There is concern that the increasing frequency and seriousness of disasters that will accompany climate change in the future will be primary risk factors to sustainable development in Vietnam.\n\nObjectives and Summary\n\nAs this program supports the response of the Vietnamese government to climate change through policy dialogues, it will contribute to sustained economic development by decreasing the risk of disasters due to climate change in Vietnam, specifically by 1) alleviating warming by curbing greenhouse gas emission and absorption, 2) strengthening the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, and 3) addressing issues across different fields that relate to climate change.\n\nThis loan will provide the financial support necessary to achieve reform in the three key areas mentioned above, and the funds will be allocated to settlement funds needed to import general commodities.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment\nAddress: 83 Nguyen Chi Thanh, Hanoi, Vietnam\nPhone: +84 (4) 8343-911, fax: +84 (4) 8359-211\n\nPlanned Implementation Schedule\n\n(i) Completion of project: September 2010 – with completion of the loan process\n(ii) Issuance of letters of invitation for consulting services:\nNo hiring of consultants is planned for this project\n(iii) Tender announcement for initial procurement package for international competitive bidding on project construction:\nNo work in conjunction with tendering is planned for this project",

Despite enormous challenges, the Palestinian Authority (PA) continues to make strides towards creating the structure of a future Palestinian State. However, during the past several years the political process has stagnated and there has been little visible progress towards a long-term peace settlement. As a consequence, the economy has continued to deteriorate with low investment, the productive base hollowing out and per capita Gross Domestic product (GDP) declining. GDP levels are only maintained through massive inflows of foreign aid that has propped up consumption and government spending. Despite this, the PA, with generous support from the international community, has moved ahead with creating the institutional structures required to provide needed services to the Palestinian people. The World Bank's ongoing technical assistance and budget support has been instrumental to these efforts, especially in helping the PA mobilize the international assistance needed to fund their operations. Regular and consistent external support is required to maintain momentum and World Bank assistance is viewed by all donors as a strong indication that the PA is fulfilling its commitments and deserves continued funding.",

It is expected that the IEEFF would finance eligible energy efficiency subprojects in key energy-intensive industries. The rationale of the proposed project are (i) to stimulate the investments in energy efficiency in key energy-intensive industries such as iron and steel, cement and petrochemical as means to achieving energy intensity reductions; and (ii) help achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reduction targets set in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011-2015 for the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund",

   "44012-013:  The project is designed to provide a suitable financing mechanism and finance energy efficiency projects in selected energy-intensive industries and ESCOs. The Hebei provincial government (HPG), through Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau (HFB), will establish a revolving escrow fund (REF) account at the selected financial intermediary to finance eligible energy efficiency subprojects. The subprojects are expected to have a loan repayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these subprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects through the REF.\n\nThe PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which provided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010. The Government of the PRC has recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated emissions. It has committed to achieve 40% 45% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared with 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions. During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006 2010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011 2015, has set a target of a further 16% energy intensity reduction. More than three fourths of the PRC s electricity and about half of its primary energy are consumed by the industrial sector. The 1,000 Key Enterprises Program was launched during the Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about two-thirds of the total industrial energy consumption. During the Twelfth plan, the ongoing program will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of 10,000 tons of coal equivalent (tce) and higher. It will involve some 16,000 enterprises in the country, primarily among nine energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel, nonferrous metal, coal, power generation, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, textile, and pulp and paper.",

Since its foundation in early 2005, Salamander has developed a broad set of assets, including producing and near-production interests in Indonesia and Thailand as well as exploration and appraisal properties in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao PDR and the Philippines. The company reported net proved and probable reserves of 66.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) and average daily production of 20,000 boe, of which about 34% is gas.\n\nSalamander is an existing client of IFC. IFC supported its growth through both debt and equity investments over the last few years. IFC has been requested to continue to support the Company’s growth by providing up to $75 million debt financing in the forms of both senior and junior lending facilities. The financing will help fund the Company’s planned 2011-2013 investment program that is primarily expected to cover the capital and operating expenditure needs of the following producing and near-production assets:\n\n- the E5-N and EU-1 Concessions (Sinphuhorm) and the Block B8/38 Concession (Bualuang) in Thailand; and\n- the Offshore North West Java (ONWJ), South East Sumatra (SES) Production Sharing Contracts, and the Glagah Kambuna Technical Assistance Contract in Indonesia.\n\nThe project will include the drilling of new wells in existing fields, the selective workover of existing wells and the construction of gas processing facilities and other field infrastructure.\n\nThe project will also include the refinancing of existing indebtedness and other general corporate uses. Salamander expects that the project will help it to increase its production to reach 30,000 boe per day by 2013.",

The loan was provided through cofinancing with a \nsyndicate of eight private financial institutions (lead arranger: Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) which has signed \na loan agreement totaling up to US$500 million with Woodside Finance Limited.  The aggregate loans will finance \nthe Pluto LNG Project in Western Australia. \n \n2. This is a joint project of Woodside, the Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. to develop the Pluto \nand Xena gas fields off Karratha in Western Australia, transport gas through an undersea pipeline to a liquefied \nnatural gas (LNG) plant to be constructed in the Burrup Peninsula and produce and sell LNG.  The proceeds of the \nloan will be applied to gas field development, and construction of a pipeline, an LNG plant, and loading facilities. \nKansai Electric and Tokyo Gas will purchase 3.75 million metric tons of LNG per year, approximately 90% of LNG \nproduced by this project under at least 15-year period sales contracts. \n \n3. The prospects of global energy balance are increasingly uncertain due to various reasons such as rapid demand \ngrowth in the emerging economies.  Considering this development, Australia, given its geological proximity to Japan \nand stable politics and economy, is increasingly important for Japan as a resource supply country.  This is \nparticularly true of natural gas, since LNG imports from Indonesia, its current largest supplier to Japan, are projected \nto decrease significantly in the near future.  In these circumstances, this project has a major significance for Japan's \nenergy security as this project will serve as a new large supply source for Japan. \n \n4. The three companies, Woodside, Kansai Electric and Tokyo Gas, are jointly undertaking the large-scale natural gas \ndevelopment project.  This loan also aims to support the resource development business of Japanese electricity and \ngas companies for helping its effective and efficient implementation.  Woodside is an important energy firm for \nsecuring a stable supply of energy resources to Japan, operating the North West Shelf Venture that has annually \nsupplied around 10 million metric tons of LNG to Japan for more than 20 years.*? This loan for the Pluto LNG \nproject is expected to strengthen relations with Woodside and to contribute to a more stable supply of energy \nresources.",

The coverage is for Apache’s investments into its subsidiaries in Egypt. MIGA’s reinsurance coverage is for a period of up to 13 years against the risks of expropriation and breach of contract. The project covered by OPIC involves existing and future exploration and development and production of crude oil, natural gas, and condensate for which multiple concession agreements have been granted by the government of Egypt.\nMIGA’s support to OPIC is in accordance with MIGA’s mandate to cooperate with national entities of its member countries, as stated in MIGA’s Convention. By providing facultative reinsurance, MIGA is enabling OPIC to provide the amount of coverage Apache has requested and was not available from private market insurers.\nThis project entails the reinsurance of a pool of new and existing investments by Apache, an oil and gas exploration and production company. Apache, through its existing and planned additional investments, has signaled its intention to stay in Egypt and to expand operations. Apache also provides technical training in new technologies to Egyptian nationals working in the joint ventures, contributes to the modernization and efficiency of the oil and gas production sector, and is playing a critical role in helping Egypt’s supply of energy products keep up with domestic demand. By supporting these investments, MIGA is underscoring its support for companies investing in Egypt during a time of transition.\nThe project is also consistent with MIGA’s efforts to mobilize $1 billion in insurance capacity to support foreign direct investment into the Middle East and North Africa.",

This additional grant will complement the Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project grant of US$12.7 million approved in July 2010, and will enable the purchase of a five megawatt (MW) thermal power generator.  “This additional financing is important because it will enable the city of Bissau to double electricity supply from the public utility company, Water and Electricity of Guinea Bissau, thus improving the reliability of clean water supply and the business climate”, said Moez Cherif, Senior Energy Economist and World Bank Task Team Leader of the project.  Guinea-Bissau is facing structural deficit in electricity generation and distribution. It is currently generating about 4 MW of power on a regular basis, while the unrestricted demand for power in Bissau has been estimated at about 30 MW. “The Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation project is only the first step toward larger investments and reforms of the electricity and water sectors. Other donors are also contributing to this effort”, Moez Cherif added.\nBecause of the failure of public electricity supply, there is an estimated 20 MW of private capacity installed by large consumers such as embassies, international organizations, hotels and other institutions, and around 1,000 small generators used in the residential sector. “This is costly to the fragile economy of Guinea-Bissau in terms of competitiveness and has a negative environmental impact as small diesel generators are more costly and less energy efficient than larger utility-run plants”, said Cherif.",

   "Page 1 of 2 \nhttp://www.jbic.go.jp/en/about/press/2008/0616-01/index.html \nJune 16,2008 \n1. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Koji Tanami) signed today a loan agreement totaling up \nto US$3.7 billion in project finance*1 with Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (CEO: Ian Craig), the project \nexecutor, for the Sakhalin II (Phase 2) Project off the coast of Sakhalin Oblast, Russian Federation.  The loan is \ncofinanced with a syndicate of the commercial banks, with the syndicate providing finance in the aggregate amount \nof up to US$1.6 billion. \n \n2. Under this large-scale project, Sakhalin Energy, in which Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corporation, Gazprom, a \nstate-owned enterprise of Russia boasting the largest natural gas reserves in the world, and the oil giant Shell have \nequity stakes, undertakes the oil/natural gas development and production in two mining fields of Piltun-Astokhskoye \nand Lunskoye off Sakhalin Island.  The proceeds of the loan will be applied to the construction of a marine platform, \nconstruction of oil and gas pipelines, and construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant.  The project is \nexpected to produce around 9.6 million tons of LNG annually, of which more than 50% (equivalent to approximately \n8% of Japan's total LNG imports) will be delivered to Japan.  With regard to crude oil, around 150,000 barrels will be \nproduced per day (equivalent to some 4% of Japan's total oil imports) under the project, of which a substantial \npercentage will be supplied to Japan. \n \n3.  Given Japan's heavy reliance on the Middle East for energy resources, this project is expected to contribute to the \ndiversification of energy suppliers for Japan.  Especially with regard to LNG, the supply from Indonesia, one of the \nlargest suppliers for Japan, is projected to decrease considerably over the coming years, and expectations are \nrunning high for this project to newly assume the status of major supplier.  The project is therefore considered to \nplay an important role in attaining Japan's policy goal of securing a stable supply of energy resources.  Furthermore, \nlocated in Russian Far East, the project has the geographical proximity to Japan, and thus greater implications in \nterms of Japan's energy security.  Taking these project effects into considerations, JBIC has decided to support this \nproject through the provision of the loan. \n \n4. Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation have held interest in this project for many years (combined total: \n22.5%), and have engaged in large-scale energy resource development jointly with Gazprom (50% plus 1 share) \nand Shell (27.5% minus 1 share).  JBIC supports Japanese firms' overseas resource development operations \nthrough the provision of this loan.  Since Gazprom, Russia's state-owned enterprise taking pride in the world's \nlargest natural gas reserves, takes part in this project, JBIC is expected to strengthen ties with a natural gas- \nproducing country through assistance activities, thereby contributing to the securing of Japan's energy resources. \n \n5. Since the project is located near Hokkaido, stakeholders in Hokkaido have expressed concerns over possible \nproject impacts on the environment.  In an effort to ensure that these concerns are reflected in the measures \n(including the oil spill response) which will be taken due to environmental and social considerations, JBIC has been \nworking with Sakhalin Energy, and will continue to do so through the monitoring of the project for the coming years. \n \n6.  In celebration of the signing of the loan agreement, JBIC received the following comments from stakeholders of this \nproject: \n \nMitsui & Co., Ltd. \nI firmly believe that the Sakhalin II Project, the first LNG project in Russia, will make a large contribution to energy \nsecurity in the Asia and Pacific region, including Japan, and that the signing of this loan agreement will pave the way for \nthe further development of the Japan-Russia relationship.  I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the hard \nwork and perseverance shown by the banking syndicate lead by JBIC, Sakhalin Energy, LNG buyers, Gazprom, Shell, \nMitsubishi Corporation, and all parties concerned, which have made this signing possible. \n(Mr. Shoei Utsuda, President and CEO, Mitsui & Co., Ltd.) \n \nMitsubishi Corporation \nThe latest signing of the loan agreement has great significance for the Sakhalin II Project, and, as a shareholder of \nSakhalin Energy, our company welcomes the signing.  Mitsubishi Corporation will continue to make its utmost efforts, \nalong with other shareholders, to help Sakhalin Energy grow and obtain sufficient confidence of users and stakeholders \nas an energy supplier.  \n(Mr. Yorihiko Kojima, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Corporation) \n \nHokkaido Fisheries Environmental Centre\n7/6/11 9:25 PM \nJBIC | JBIC Signs Loan Agreement for Sakhalin II (Phase 2) Project \nCongratulations on the signing of the loan agreement totaling US$3.7 billion between JBIC and Sakhalin Energy.  The \nSakhalin II Project will play an extremely significant part in both Japan's energy security and the future development of \nJapan-Russia relationship.  We would like to pay respects to the decisive step that JBIC has taken for the project.  On \nthe other hand, it is undeniable that the implementation of the oil and gas development project in Sakhalin, an \nimmediate neighbor of Hokkaido, will entail negative impacts and risks for local populace.  Residents engaged in fishery \nin Hokkaido, including staff of this headquarters, are seriously concerned about oil spills and other accidents, which \ncould happen due to troubles in the peripheral facilities or during transportation of crude oil and LNG in the coastal \nwater body off Hokkaido, since shipping would intensify to an unprecedented level as the project progresses.  Against \nthis background, it is truly heartening for us to know that JBIC, in the capacity of a responsible governmental financial \ninstitution, has decided to assume a position, as a major lender, of using appropriate and official leverage on the project. \nWe have high hopes that JBIC will pay sufficient attention to our concerns, provide guidance and supervision to Sakhalin \nEnergy, the project executor, and make appeals to relevant government agencies. \n(Mr. Masao Hirano, Chairman) \n \n(Cf.) \nThis project has been implemented in a phased manner, with Phase 2 following Phase 1.  JBIC provided a loan totaling \nUS$116 million to finance the Project Phase 1 (December, 1997).  The proceeds of the loan were applied to crude oil \nproduction at the simple maritime production facility in the Astokhskoye structure.  Production started in July, 1999, albeit \nonly during the summer season, recovering 90,000 barrels per day at the peak time.",

Citibank has applied for a MIGA guarantee of $100 million for a period of up to seven years against the risks of expropriation, breach of contract, war and civil disturbance.  \n\nMIGA’s coverage is sought to guarantee part of a loan facility issued by a consortium of banks to Kosmos that will be used to refinance the company’s existing debt and for additional funding for its upstream development in Ghana. MIGA’s proposed coverage would be for Citibank’s participation in the total loan facility ($2 billion). Kosmos’ primary producing field is the Jubilee Field offshore Ghana. The Jubilee Field’s phase one development achieved first production in November 2010 and is now producing around 65,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) with output ramping up toward the 2011 plateau target of 120,000 bopd.",

   "11093  In December 2012, MIGA issued guarantees of up to $437 million covering an equity investment by SCDM Energie SAS of France and a non-shareholder loan from HSBC of the United Kingdom and a syndicate of commercial banks for the CI 27 gas field in Côte d’Ivoire. In April 2013, MIGA increased the equity investment cover by $8.1 million, and in June 2013  issued an additional  guarantee of $57 million covering SCDM’s shareholder loan to the project enterprise. The coverage is for a period of up to seven years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.\nThe project consists of the construction and operation of Block CI-27 on/offshore oil and gas facilities including an existing production platform (Foxtrot), gas transportation and onshore facilities, and a greenfield platform (Marlin).\nThe Block CI 27 expansion project aims to meet the country’s growing energy demand. Côte d’Ivoire’s energy sector has suffered from a lack of investment during the last 10 years, as the country struggled with civil conflict. Now that the country’s situation is improving, a significant increase in energy investment is necessary to meet the population’s needs and support further development. Tapping Côte d’Ivoire’s gas resources will reduce the country’s energy costs and limit the use of foreign reserves for energy imports. \nThe project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for Côte d’Ivoire, which stresses the critical importance of building energy capacity to sustain economic progress.\nMIGA’s support for this investment is also aligned with the agency’s strategy of supporting investments in countries eligible for concessional financing by the International Development Association, countries affected by conflict, and complex infrastructure projects.",

Iraq's oil and gas resources are among the largest in the world. Despite significant efforts to revitalize the Iraqi energy sector after the extensive damage caused by the conflict in 2003, major challenges remain. Efforts to strengthen operations and reconstitute physical infrastructure within the sector have met with mixed success, limiting the ability to deliver domestic energy supplies and generate reliable and adequate export revenues. Coordinated planning between the relevant government agencies is currently weak. Reliable access to high-quality energy supplies is a widely recognized enabling factor in economic development, and the long-running inability to provide such supplies is seriously detrimental to the welfare of the Iraqi population. In addition, as crude oil exports represent 98 percent of total exports and oil revenues make up 96 percent of total budget revenue (excluding grants), the ability to utilize Iraq's natural resources in a sustainable and equitable manner is essential to the future of the nation's economy.",

   "August 10, 2010 \n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on August 9 a \nbuyer's credit*2 agreement in the amount of up to 900 million US dollars with the EGYPTIAN REFINING COMPANY \n(TAKRIR) S.A.E. (ERC), a company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt, provided under project financing*3. \nThis loan was cofinanced with the following commercial banks: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (the Facility \nAgent); Société Générale Tokyo Branch; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Tokyo Branch; \nStandard Chartered Bank Tokyo Branch, ; Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Tokyo Branch and The \nSumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., with the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing Buyer's \nCredit Insurance for the cofinanced portion. Besides this loan, the project has also been financed by other export \ncredit agencies and multilateral institutions, namely the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the European Investment Bank \nand the African Development  Bank. This is the first project finance loan that JBIC has provided to a project in the \nArab Republic of Egypt. \n \n2. In this Project, ERC, in which Citadel Capital S.A.E., an Egyptian investment company, and the Egyptian General \nPetroleum Corporation (EGPC) have equity stakes, will construct, own and operate processing units to refine \natmospheric residue to be fed from EGPC's existing Cairo Refinery, and will then sell diesel and other refined \nproducts to EGPC over the long-term. JBIC is financing ERC to construct the new processing units, the EPC \ncontractor for which is a joint venture which includes Mitsui & Co., Ltd., thereby supporting the export of Japanese \nplant facilities and machinery.  \n \n3. With many of its existing refineries equipped with simple and outdated distillation units, Egypt, an exporter of surplus \nfuel oil, is unable to meet domestic demand for middle distillates such as diesel and relies on imports for such \nproducts. The Project is aimed at substituting such imports with domestic production by installing advanced \nprocessing facilities. Additionally, the Project is expected to contribute to environmental improvement, as the \nproduction of high-quality refined products with the state-of-the-art facilities to be installed will reduce emissions of \nsuch air pollutants as NOx and SOx. \n \n4. During the fourth meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in May 2008, the \ngovernment of Japan pledged to offer some 2.5 billion US dollars in financial support to Africa over a 5-year period \nthrough JBIC operations.  This loan, which supports Japanese firms' exports to Africa, is well aligned with this \ngovernment policy.   \n \n5. When the Project was forced to reconsider its financing plan due to the credit squeeze in the aftermath of the \nfinancial crisis in 2008, JBIC decided to participate in this Project and helped structure effective financing in \ncollaboration with other public financial institutions, while drawing on its abundant experience in project finance.  To \ncreate export opportunities for Japanese industries, JBIC will continue its support for Japanese overseas business \nactivities by drawing on its expertise, risk-assuming function and wide range of financial instruments. \n\nMay 6, 2010 IFC project# 29128: The project consists of the construction of a 5 million ton per annum hydro-cracking and coking facility in Mostorod, Greater Cairo, by the Egyptian Refining Company SAE (“ERC” or the “Company”) to upgrade locally available refinery atmospheric residue into lighter products, such as ultra low sulfur Euro V diesel and high octane gasoline blending component, for the domestic Egyptian market (the “Project”). The Project will also include environmental upgrades to the adjoining facilities of state-owned Cairo Oil Refining Company (“CORC”) and Petroleum Pipeline Company (“PPC”). \nEgyptian General Petroleum Company (“EGPC”), a Government of Egypt (“GOE”) economic authority, and owner of both CORC and PPC, will supply most of the feedstock to the Project and off-take most of its production. The Project is seen by GOE as an important import substitution project which will address the strong deficit of lighter petroleum products in the Greater Cairo region, which represents about half of the Egyptian refined products market, and Egypt’s surplus of atmospheric residue/fuel oil.",

It is for this reason that in the \u0081gNational Development Strategy 2005-2007\" dated June 2005, the Iraqi government designated the development of oil sector as one of the highest priorities for strengthening the foundations of economic growth. Specifically, the government plans to increase its crude oil production capacity from the current 2 million/BPD (barrels per day) to 6 million/BPD in the next 10 years, which needs additional investment of more than $20 billion to develop oil-related facilities including crude oil production and export facilities.\nIn the oil sector, the refining sub-sector is currently facing a huge demand-supply gap in gasoline and other petroleum products, i.e. shortage of gasoline by 7,000 cubic meters per day, due to declining capacities of oil refining facilities due to war damage and excessive aging, and increasing domestic demand for petroleum products in the process of postwar reconstruction as well. As a result, the government has to import petroleum products to mitigate supply shortage, which led to a foreign currency outflow of $200 million equivalent every month. Under these circumstances, there is an urgent need to rehabilitate and expand refining facilities for increasing the country's oil refining capacity.\nThe objective of the project is to increase the production of gasoline and other petroleum products for private-sector users, by installing a Fluid Catalyst Cracking (FCC) unit and its relevant facilities, which increase the productivity of gasoline and other petroleum in the existing refinery in Basrah, southern Iraq. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be applied to basic designing and relevant studies for the project.\nProject executing agency: Ministry of Oil (MOO)\nAddress: P.O.

Specifically, the government plans to gradually increase crude oil production in the southern region, which accounts for 80% of crude oil exports, from the current 2 million BPD (barrels per day) to 5.3 million BPD. This will require additional investment in developing oil-related facilities, including crude oil production facilities and export terminals.\nMost of the oil-related facilities in Iraq were built in the 1970s. As several conflicts in the area have prevented new investment and adequate maintenance over the years, oil facilities have deteriorated leading to a lack of reliability and capacity in those facilities. In particular, an offshore crude oil export facility in Fao, Basrah Governorate, is facing a serious decline in the reliability of its operation. Furthermore, given the plan to expand crude oil production capacity in the coming years, its current capacity (2.1 million barrel/day) is highly insufficient. There is thus an urgent need to ensure stable operations and enhance the capacity of its facilities.\nThe project aims to stabilize and expand the country's crude oil export capacity, a lifeline of the Iraqi economy, by constructing a pipeline connecting the inland crude oil storage to the offshore crude oil export terminal in FAO, Basrah Governorate, where a decline in the reliability of aging equipment and substantial capacity shortage are hindering its safe and stable operations.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be applied to the construction of a new pipeline and an offshore SPM (Single Point Mooring) loading facility, and relevant consulting services.\nProject executing agency: Ministry of Oil (MOO)\nAddress: P.O.

   "March 31, 2010 \n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on March 30 a \nloan agreement in the aggregate amount of up to 497 million US dollars with P&M Drilling International B.V. (P&M), \na company incorporated in the Netherlands in which Mitsui & Co. and Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), a state- \nowned oil company in Brazil, have equity stakes. The loan, provided in project financing,*2 will finance the ultra- \ndeepwater oil drillship (rig)*3 project for drilling in Brazilian and overseas coastal waters. The loan is cofinanced with \nthe Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (lead arranger), with JBIC providing a partial guarantee for the cofinanced \nportion. \n \n2. In this project, P&M will build and own an ultra-deepwater drilling rig and provide drilling service for 20 years \nthrough Transocean Group, the world's largest deepwater drilling rig operator. Developing ultra-deepwater oil wells \non the seabed in the so-called “presalt” areas is an urgent business agenda for Petrobras. The company has thus \npressing needs for ultra-deepwater drilling rigs whose worldwide supply is currently tight. This drilling rig will be the \nfirst to be owned jointly by Petrobras and a Japanese firm (Mitsui and Co.). \n \n3. As demand for ultra-deepwater drilling is increasing in Brazil and other parts of the world, there is the prospect of \nexpanding market for ultra-deepwater drilling rigs. Japanese firms are thus planning to enter this market. In addition \nto Mitsui and Co., which has participated in this project, Japan Drilling Company, Ltd. (JDC), Japan's only offshore \ndrilling contractor, has also participated, serving as a technical consultant to Mitsui & Co. By strengthening ties with \nPetrobras, JDC hopes to participate in ultra-deepwater oil drilling projects to be undertaken by Petrobras, as it is a \nleading user in the global rig market.",

   "August 10, 2010 \n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on August 9 a \nbuyer's credit*2 agreement in the amount of up to 900 million US dollars with the EGYPTIAN REFINING COMPANY \n(TAKRIR) S.A.E. (ERC), a company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt, provided under project financing*3. \nThis loan was cofinanced with the following commercial banks: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (the Facility \nAgent); Société Générale Tokyo Branch; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Tokyo Branch; \nStandard Chartered Bank Tokyo Branch, ; Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Tokyo Branch and The \nSumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., with the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing Buyer's \nCredit Insurance for the cofinanced portion. Besides this loan, the project has also been financed by other export \ncredit agencies and multilateral institutions, namely the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the European Investment Bank \nand the African Development  Bank. This is the first project finance loan that JBIC has provided to a project in the \nArab Republic of Egypt. \n \n2. In this Project, ERC, in which Citadel Capital S.A.E., an Egyptian investment company, and the Egyptian General \nPetroleum Corporation (EGPC) have equity stakes, will construct, own and operate processing units to refine \natmospheric residue to be fed from EGPC's existing Cairo Refinery, and will then sell diesel and other refined \nproducts to EGPC over the long-term. JBIC is financing ERC to construct the new processing units, the EPC \ncontractor for which is a joint venture which includes Mitsui & Co., Ltd., thereby supporting the export of Japanese \nplant facilities and machinery.  \n \n3. With many of its existing refineries equipped with simple and outdated distillation units, Egypt, an exporter of surplus \nfuel oil, is unable to meet domestic demand for middle distillates such as diesel and relies on imports for such \nproducts. The Project is aimed at substituting such imports with domestic production by installing advanced \nprocessing facilities. Additionally, the Project is expected to contribute to environmental improvement, as the \nproduction of high-quality refined products with the state-of-the-art facilities to be installed will reduce emissions of \nsuch air pollutants as NOx and SOx. \n \n4. During the fourth meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in May 2008, the \ngovernment of Japan pledged to offer some 2.5 billion US dollars in financial support to Africa over a 5-year period \nthrough JBIC operations.  This loan, which supports Japanese firms' exports to Africa, is well aligned with this \ngovernment policy.   \n \n5. When the Project was forced to reconsider its financing plan due to the credit squeeze in the aftermath of the \nfinancial crisis in 2008, JBIC decided to participate in this Project and helped structure effective financing in \ncollaboration with other public financial institutions, while drawing on its abundant experience in project finance.  To \ncreate export opportunities for Japanese industries, JBIC will continue its support for Japanese overseas business \nactivities by drawing on its expertise, risk-assuming function and wide range of financial instruments. \n\nMay 6, 2010 IFC project# 29128: The project consists of the construction of a 5 million ton per annum hydro-cracking and coking facility in Mostorod, Greater Cairo, by the Egyptian Refining Company SAE (“ERC” or the “Company”) to upgrade locally available refinery atmospheric residue into lighter products, such as ultra low sulfur Euro V diesel and high octane gasoline blending component, for the domestic Egyptian market (the “Project”). The Project will also include environmental upgrades to the adjoining facilities of state-owned Cairo Oil Refining Company (“CORC”) and Petroleum Pipeline Company (“PPC”). \nEgyptian General Petroleum Company (“EGPC”), a Government of Egypt (“GOE”) economic authority, and owner of both CORC and PPC, will supply most of the feedstock to the Project and off-take most of its production. The Project is seen by GOE as an important import substitution project which will address the strong deficit of lighter petroleum products in the Greater Cairo region, which represents about half of the Egyptian refined products market, and Egypt’s surplus of atmospheric residue/fuel oil.",

The guarantees will have a term of up to 15 years, providing coverage against the risk of breach of contract.\n\nThe project consists of the construction (on a build, own, and operate basis) of an 87 megawatt heavy fuel oil plant located at Thika, approximately 35 kilometers from Nairobi. Melec PowerGen Inc. was awarded the contract following a competitive bidding process for the development of the Thika plant. The total project cost is estimated at €112.3 million ($151 million). Thika has entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lightning Co. The project is supported by a standby letter of credit from a commercial bank and is further guaranteed by an International Development Association (IDA) partial risk guarantee to cover short-term liquidity.\n\nKenya is facing ongoing energy shortages driven in part by the economy’s rapid growth. A recent World Bank study found that unreliable electricity supply lowers the annual sale revenues of Kenyan firms by about 7 percent and reduces Kenyan annual GDP growth by about 1.5 percent. The additional 87 megawatts provided by the plant will directly contribute to economic growth by reducing the energy shortfall that threatens economic growth and providing power supply consistent with the country’s Least Cost Power Development Plan.

The coverage to all guarantee holders is for a period of up to 12 years against the risk of breach of contract.\nThe project consists of the construction of an 83 megawatt heavy fuel oil plant on a build, own, and operate basis. The plant will be located at Kitengela, near the Athi River, approximately 25 kilometers from Nairobi. Triumph will enter into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company.\nThe World Bank’s Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic found that the lack of adequate, reliable electricity supply is Kenya’s largest infrastructure challenge and a key constraint to economic growth (contributing to economic losses of an estimated 2 percent of GDP). The project will help Kenya achieve a more diversified energy mix and stability to its power generation.

There are three components to the project. The first component is the remediation of the Malargue site. The project will fund remediation works, including the safe disposal of 710,000 tons of tailings and soils, structures to prevent groundwater contamination and dust, and measures to abate radiation and radon emissions. Contracting has been done in conformance with World Bank procedures and civil works have already begun (and as of May, 2008, the required investment is about 30 percent complete). Independent construction supervision conducted by a Bank-hired technical expert has reviewed the design and certified the quality of construction to date. The second component is the mine restoration planning and institutional strengthening. The project will provide technical assistance to study and design remediation options to clean up the additional sites, and support the environmental and social consultation processes required as per international best practice. The project will also fund an international advisory group to advice on the approaches being suggested for each site. Finally, the third component is the project management. The project implementation unit of the GP will be responsible for project implementation, reporting, project monitoring, and impact evaluation of key interventions.",

(U1) (UUU.TO), a major, Canadian-listed producer \nand marketer of uranium. TEPCO, Toshiba and JBIC have agreed to subscribe to a new share issue of 117 million \nshares in U1, at a price of Cdn$2.30 per share, equal to approximately Cdn$270 million (about 20.2 billion yen*1) in \ntotal. Concurrently, TEPCO, Toshiba and JBIC have also signed a strategic relationship agreement (SRA) with U1, and \na Uranium Offtake Agreement. \n \n?The full share issue will be taken up by Japan Uranium Management Inc. (JUMI), a special purpose entity established \nby the three Japanese companies in British Columbia, Canada. Once JUMI completes the transaction, U1's outstanding \nshares will total 586.61 million, and JUMI will have a holding of about 19.95%. TEPCO and Toshiba will each hold 40% \nof JUMI's shares, and JBIC will hold 20%. \n \n?In order to further deepen and develop their long-term strategic relationship with U1, the three Japanese companies \nintend to appoint two representatives to serve on U1's board, and to send other personnel to the company; establish a \njoint committee to discuss strategic issues; and evaluate opportunities to jointly develop uranium resources. The \nJapanese companies and U1 will together develop and execute detailed action plans based on the SRA. \n \n?TEPCO operates a large scale nuclear generation program in Japan, and pursues economically efficient means to \noptimize its uranium procurement, including diversification of procurement channels, and will continue to enhance its fuel \nprocurement activities, especially in front-end domains. \n?Toshiba strives to take advantage of every opportunity to promote initiatives and programs to satisfy demand for \nuranium for the Group's utility customers on a global basis. \n?JBIC aims to support activities to secure uranium resources for Japan and to maintain and improve international \ncompetitiveness within the nuclear industry of Japan. From this perspective, JBIC supports this first-ever equity \ninvestment by Japanese companies in a major uranium company as a joint investor, and seeks to sustain U1's \nbusinesses by drawing on its own experience and capabilities, based on an existing relationship, to have dialogue \ndirectly with Kazakhstan where U1 has mining sites.",

Project component: Component 1) the gas storage facility will be in an underground salt formation located close to Tuz Golu, a salt lake in South Central Turkey. The facility will have 12 caverns which will be solution-mined in phases of four caverns each. The facility, upon completion, will have a storage capacity of about 960 million cubic meters of working gas and 460 million cubic meters of cushion gas. Component 2) the project will also finance two compressor stations for BOTAS at Erzincan and Corum and other network infrastructure. These stations are required to help transmit the increasing volumes of gas expected to be imported into Turkey from existing and new sources. The Corum station will have a capacity of 30 MW and is required in order to enable increased supply from Russia, while the Erzincan station will have 39 MW of compression capacity and will enable the import of natural gas from Azerbaijan.

The expansion was designed to utilize the supply of indigenous gas in the Uch Gas Field (“UGF”) and to increase the supply of low cost power to the country. \n\nUPL proposed a 404 MW combined cycle expansion project (“Uch II” or the “Project”) on a Build-Own-Operate (“BOO”) basis. All energy that would be produced by the Project would be sold to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (“NTDC”) under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement, backed by a GOP Guarantee. An Implementation Agreement would be signed prior to financial close that would entail the GOP’s support for the project and would also lay out the rights and obligations of all parties.\n\nThe proposed expansion will be structured as a standalone Independent Power Plant (“IPP”) and will be built on the site of the first plant, utilizing the available vacant land, and will use some of the existing physical and management infrastructure. The project will use the indigenous gas that is available in the UGF and is being used by the first plant. In addition to the infrastructure, the project will operate with the existing plant in the form of a shared management team as well as common utilization of O&M resources and administrative staff. The synergies are expected to result in a shorter construction period as well as reduced overall project costs, which would result in a more competitive tariff for the project. Similar to the operating 586 MW Uch-I plant, the new plant  is expected to be a low-cost producer of power in the country and would be in line with IFC’s strategy to support the development of low cost thermal power and help improve sector operating costs.\n\nThe Project will be established under a separate project company, called Uch-II Power (Private Limited), which will be established in Islamabad and will be 100% owned by IP. Headquartered in London, IP is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has regional offices in Boston, Singapore, Melbourne and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at US $500 million. \n\nThe proposed IFC investment is an A-loan for IFC’s own account of up to US $100 million.",

A typical LNG truck will have 90% fewer NOX and PM emissions than a diesel truck, 100% fewer SOX emissions, and 30% fewer Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. LNG fuel also enjoys very favorable economics over petroleum– with fuel cost savings typically reported in the 30% range as compared to diesel. The objective of the Project is to, together with other similar projects currently undertaken by other gas distribution companies, build a country-wide LNG distribution network in China that will make LNG available to thousands of long-haul buses and heavy trucks along the major inter-province highways and it is expected that the increased availability of the LNG will stimulate a broad conversion of heavy trucks and long haul buses from traditionally being diesel powered to gas powered. \n\nThe sponsor of the Project is ENN Energy Holdings Ltd (“ENN”), formerly known as Xinao Gas, an existing IFC client and a leading gas distribution company in China.

   "The electricity sector in the country is facing a lack of capacity in all sub-sectors, i.e. generation, transmission and distribution, due to insufficient operation and maintenance and a lack of new investment in the past, despite its importance for all economic and social activities. The electricity sector is thus one of the most important sectors for reconstruction in Iraq. The generation capacity that exceeded 9,000 MW in the 1990s has plunged to less than 4,000 MW in recent years, leading to frequent load shedding throughout the country. Power outages are affecting not only household and business activities but also the operations of basic infrastructure facilities such as water supply and sewerage systems, and hospitals, posing a major obstacle to the restoration of social stability and economic recovery. Rehabilitation of power generation facilities is therefore an urgent challenge in the country.\nThe objective of the project is to expand the power generation capacity of Iraq and increase its efficiency and reliability. The project consists of rehabilitation of the existing Al-Mussaib Thermal Power Plant (300 MW\u0081~4), located near the Baghdad metropolitan area and one of the key power plants in Iraq, whose power output and capacity utilization rate have significantly decreased due to inadequate operation and maintenance.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be applied to rehabilitation of two power generation units (Units No.1 and No.3), repairing common facilities and relevant consulting services.\nProject executing agency: Ministry of Electricity (MOE) \nAddress: Al-Husan Square, Babylon, Iraq",

The loan is co-financed with financial institutions, including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Islamic financial institutions. \nThis is, for JBIC, the first loan in project financing, co-financed with Islamic financial institutions for Qatar.*2 \n2.  In this project, RGPC, which Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc. and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. established jointly with Suez Tractebel S.A., a Belgian energy infrastructure company, Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Electricity & Water Company Q.S.C., will construct a natural gas-fired combined thermal power plant (capacity: 2,730MW) and a water desalination plant (capacity: 63 million gallons per day) in Ras Laffan Industrial City located in northeastern Qatar.  The project employs a BOT scheme,*3in which electricity and water generated under the project will be sold to Qatar General Electricity & Water Corporation (Kahramaa) for 25 years. \n \n3. Demand for electric power and water has been increasing in Qatar due to sharp population growth and rising \nindustrial demands including in the petrochemical sector, and it is anticipated that their demand will increase by about 10.8% and 9.5% per annum respectively until 2015.  The Project is expected to make up approximately 30% and 20% of the country's total electrical generation and water supply capacity respectively in 2012 and play an important role as its major supply source of electricity and water. \n \n4. Amid the tightening demand for natural resources across the world, it is important for Japan to strengthen its relationship with the countries with reserves of natural resources.  Qatar boasts not only the world's third largest natural gas reserves; the country is also the fourth largest LNG supplier (12%) to Japan and one of the most important sources of resource for Japan.  In this light, JBIC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on \ncomprehensive strategic partnership with Qatar Petroleum in November, 2006.  This loan, which was realized \nfollowing a number of consultations based on the MOU, will contribute to the development of the power and water \nsector infrastructure in Qatar, which is urgently called for to ensure Qatar's stable economic growth.

The loan was provided in \ncofinancing with a bank syndicate led by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited(HSBC), Tokyo \nBranch and others as lead arrangers.  \n \n2. The loan will finance a project where EODC procures equipment necessary for developing offshore gas fields in \nEgyptian waters, and offers it in the long term for use in gas development.  This is a Japanese company-led \ninvestment project undertaken by EODC, a project company set up by Toyota Tsusho Corporation and two \ngovernmental oil and gas companies: the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and Ganoub El-Wadi \nPetroleum Holding Co. (GANOPE).  \n \n3. Oil production in Egypt has been declining since the first half of the 1990s.  International Energy Agency (IEA) \nprojected that the country could shift towards being a net oil importer around 2015.  By contrast, its natural gas \noutput has been increasing at a fast pace in recent years, turning it into a net exporter of natural gas in 2004. \nCurrently, Egypt ranks as the 17th largest natural gas producer in the world, according to the BP Statistical Review \nof World Energy 2008.  In this context, the Egyptian government aims to expand natural gas production and \nexports.  However, brisk resource development activities have caused a shortage of drilling rigs and other equipment \nindispensable for gas development.  The project will alleviate this bottleneck to expansion in natural gas production, \nthereby making a significant contribution to Egypt’s energy policy to expand production of natural gas for exports.  \n \n4. Given increasingly tight global supplies of resources, strengthening ties with resource-endowed countries is high on \nthe Japanese agenda.  Against this background, JBIC signed in September 2007 Memorandums of Understanding \n(MOU) aimed at strengthening mutual ties with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and EGAS to build \ncooperative relations for developing the oil and gas businesses in Egypt.

The loan will finance MEPUSA acquiring a 15.5% interest in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania from \nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation and for participating in its development. This is the first loan JBIC has provided for \na shale gas project. \n \n3. Shale gas is a natural gas contained in shale, and is one of main types of unconventional natural gas.  Previously, \nits production was marginal and commercialization was considered difficult.  However, technological advances, such \nas horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have made low-cost production possible and its development has been \nrapid, especially in the United States.  In fact, more than 10% of US natural gas supply is now estimated to come \nfrom shale gas, with oil majors and newly participating firms vigorously engaging in the shale gas business in the \nUnited States.  \n \n4. For Mitsui and MOECO, the acquisition of interests through MEPUSA in the US natural gas market, a huge and \nflexible market, will diversify their supply portfolio and strengthen their corporate ability to balance demand and \nsupply.  In addition, developing unconventional gas in the U.S. will help relieve the tight Asian LNG market and \ncontribute to developing a more stable market, which is beneficial for Japanese LNG buyers.

   "(3) Kuraymat Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (II)\n(a) Background and Necessity\nRecently in Egypt, electricity demand has been growing at an annual rate of about 10% while the electricity supply reserve rate remains at around 1%, resulting in a very tight supply-demand condition. Therefore, systematic construction of power plants according to the growth of demand is an urgent issue to keep steady supply of electricity. At the same time, the Egyptian Government focuses on the construction of power plants based on new and renewable energy in order to reduce environmental load while meeting the growing need for electricity. The National Five-Year Development Plan for FY2007-2012 aims to procure 1,490MW, or about 5% of the power plants to be improved by FY2010, by new and renewable energy.\nThis project is the first power generation project that uses a solar heat collection system in Egypt based on the Five-Year Plan. The project also has an important role as a pilot project in applying solar heat power generation to practice in Egypt. Phase 1 of the project had been already provided Japanese ODA Loan in January 2006.\nThe project applies to practice the technology of integrating solar heat and gas power generation for the first time in the world, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), an organization that supports measures for protecting the global environment, has decided to provide grant aid to cover the cost of introducing this new technology. This means that this is a co-assistance project within the international cooperation framework to tackle climate change.\n\n(b) Objective and Project Summary\nThe purpose of this project is to construct an integrated solar combined cycle power plant with a capacity of 150MW in Kuraymat, about 100km south of Cairo City, to generate electricity to be provided to existing transmission networks in the country.

Efforts to bolster the energy sector are essential to avoid blackouts, such as the ones Ghana experienced in 2008.\n\nThe project fits into the government’s power sector plans, which specifically seek to increase installed capacity from 2000 megawatts to 5000 megawatts and enable Ghana to become a net exporter of electricity to neighboring countries by 2015.",

   "10517  On December 28, 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee of $221.4 million to Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) of the United Kingdom to cover its non-shareholder loan to Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) in Bangladesh. HSBC coordinated and arranged a $406 million financing package to APSCL for the project. On March 8, 2013, MIGA issued additional coverage of $30 million covering a swap arrangement to hedge against long-term interest rate risk. MIGA’s guarantees are for a period of up to 13.5 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations. The Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh has provided an unconditional sovereign guarantee covering payment obligations of APSCL under the debt financing and the swap.\nThe project consists of the construction of a 450-megawatt combined cycle gas-fired plant on the basis of a contract awarded by APSCL to a consortium of TSK Electronica y Electricidad S.A. (Spain) and Inelectra International AB (Sweden). This project will replace certain existing units in the Ashuganj facility that will be decommissioned once the new plant is completed.\nBangladesh currently faces an acute shortage of power generation capacity. This impairs the country's economic and social development and constrains growth. The government of Bangladesh has made energy a high priority and recently adopted an updated Power Sector Master Plan, which includes this project. This project will help meet the country‘s growing demand for power, using a domestic gas resource and efficient technology.\nMIGA's participation in this transaction is critical to mobilizing the debt financing for this project. The project is consistent with MIGA's strategic priorities of supporting investment into IDA countries and complex projects.",

The generated heat will also serve to dry the sludge prior to incineration.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe project’s economic interest is linked to its contribution to improving the waste management system in the Province of Parma by reducing the amounts of untreated municipal waste sent to landfill, particularly biodegradable material. The project is part of a wider regional waste management plan, designed to further improve minimised waste production, selective waste collection and increasing the share of municipal waste subject to recovery, treatment and recycling. The plant will furthermore involve energy generation (electricity and heat) from municipal solid waste, which is in the EU and national context considered partly to be a renewable energy source.",

The project will also connect more end-users to the power grid in the Gereshk town center with more efficient distribution network. A. Physical Outputs of Tranche 3 (i) Rehabilitation of Gereshk Hydro Power Station. (i) installation of 3 units of new turbines with installed capacity of 4.5 MW, (ii) modernizing the power house with gantry crane and other equipment, (iii) replacements of bypass channel radial gates, water gates and stoplogs at Boghra canal intake, and (iv) repair of eroded and collapsed banks of the canal; (ii) Upgrading of distribution network. (i) Replacement of the existing 3.3/44 kV substation at the hydro power plant with a new 3.3/20 kV substation; (ii) Re-building or re-using the 44 kV overhead line to the Gereshk town substation; (iii) Replacement of 44/3.3 kV town substation with a new 20/3.3 kV step down point; (iv) Reinforcement the supplies into the existing 3.3 kV network by installing new 20 kV circuits and 20/3.3 kV transformers; (v) Complete replacement of the existing Gereshk 3.3 kV network with a new 20 kV distribution network. (iii) New and replacements of customer service connections. New and replacement of the low voltage customer service connections and installation of new metering for about 7,500 households in the Gereshk town center area.\nThe access to reliable power supply is severely limited in Gereshk. The estimated population of Gereshk District is 70,000, out of which 50,000 people, or 7,500 households, reside within the 6 km radius of the town center. Presently only about 2,500 households have connections to the local electricity distribution system, while 5,000 households claim to await new connections. Some have their own diesel generators which are too expensive for the mass and the poor. Even for those connected to the electricity network, chronic load shedding during both the morning and evening peak hours means that most receive only a few hours of power supply a day and the existing infrastructure does not allow continued access to power.",

The first is renewable energy. The project will finance renewable resources, such as geothermal, for heating and cooling purposes. \n\nAt the request of the Financial Intermediary (FI), the eligibility criteria for hydro-power projects have been altered to reflect the definition of renewable hydro-power projects in the renewable energy law, which defines small hydro as projects with a reservoir area limited to less than 15 km. \n\nThe Clean Technology Fund (CTF) will finance small hydro, those less than or equal to 10 MW in capacity, in addition to other emerging renewable technologies. \n\nThe second component is investment in energy efficiency. Some of the sub-sectors likely to be borrowers include iron and steel, cement, ceramics, chemicals, and textiles. \n\nFinally, the third component is the use of CTF resources. The benefits of the CTF financing will be lower interest rates and significantly longer tenor, which are expected to be large enough to significantly increase the incentive to undertake these projects.

   "Small-scale agriculture is the main industry in Vanuatu and the few export products means a chronic deficit in the international trade balance. Up to around 1990, electricity was mainly generated by diesel engine generators using imported diesel oil, constituting a heavy burden on the national economy. Under these circumstances, the Government of Vanuatu adopted the breaking away from the dependence on oil as a priority target, formulated an energy programme primarily featuring a shift to hydroelectric power generation and made a request to the Government of Japan for the implementation of a project to build the Sarakata River Hydroelectric Power Station to supply electricity to Luganville.\n\n \n\nIn response to this request, the Government of Japan implemented the Project to Construct the Sarakata River Hydroelectric Power Station on Santo Island (hereinafter referred to as “the previous project”) in 1994 and 1995 as a grant aid project. Following the construction of this new power station with two 300 kW turbine generators (combined generating capacity of 600 kW), this power station supplied as much as 70% of the electricity supplied to Luganville in 1995, contributing to the breaking away from the dependence on oil for some time. However, the conspicuous growth of the power demand in the area in subsequent years made it impossible for the rated generating capacity of this hydroelectric power station to meet the peak power demand. This situation led to renewed dependence on diesel oil generation and the resulting increase of the diesel oil procurement cost began to oppress the economy of Vanuatu. To alleviate the situation, the Government of Vanuatu made a further request to the Government of Japan for the provision of grant aid for the installation of a new 600 kW hydraulic turbine generator at the Sarakata River Hydroelectric Power Station.\n\nCONTACTS:\nJICA Project Manager:\nKiyofusa Tanaka",

The first is renewable energy. The project will finance renewable resources, such as geothermal, for heating and cooling purposes. \n\nAt the request of the Financial Intermediary (FI), the eligibility criteria for hydro-power projects have been altered to reflect the definition of renewable hydro-power projects in the renewable energy law, which defines small hydro as projects with a reservoir area limited to less than 15 km. \n\nThe Clean Technology Fund (CTF) will finance small hydro, those less than or equal to 10 MW in capacity, in addition to other emerging renewable technologies. \n\nThe second component is investment in energy efficiency. Some of the sub-sectors likely to be borrowers include iron and steel, cement, ceramics, chemicals, and textiles. \n\nFinally, the third component is the use of CTF resources. The benefits of the CTF financing will be lower interest rates and significantly longer tenor, which are expected to be large enough to significantly increase the incentive to undertake these projects.

The Project consists of the construction of a 156-megawatt hydropower plant on the Song Bung in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin and a 110-meter (m)-high roller compacted concrete dam on the same river with a crest length of 367 m. The Project is located in Nam Giang District of Quang Nam Province in Central Viet Nam, which is predominantly inhabited by indigenous people belonging to the Co Tu ethnic minority. The SB 4 Hydropower Project will result in the relocation of more than 1,200 Co Tu ethnic minority people in Zuoih commune in Nam Giang District. The resettlement cost is funded by the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN). The Project is also supported by a complementary grant of $2 million financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) under Grant 9120: Livelihood Improvement of Vulnerable Ethnic Minority Communities Affected by the SB 4 Hydropower Project in Quang Nam Province. The JFPR project was approved by ADB on 26 June 2008 and became effective on 10 November 2008. The SB 4 Hydropower Project has several negative social impacts on the people who live in the reservoir, downstream, and upstream areas. The impacts include the (i) relocation of more than 1,200 people living in the reservoir area, which represents more than 97% of the people in the area, and 27,340 people from 89 villages along the Bung River downstream and upstream of the dam; and (ii) acquisition of land for more than 500 ethnic minority people for the development of resettlement sites and access roads to resettlement sites. In view of these, SB 4 Hydropower Project is considered a high-risk project.\n\nFunding source: Technical Assistance Special Fund",

This component will address the lack of protection devices in the substations that put the integrity of the entire network system in jeopardy. Second component of the project is Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) Program. This component will distribute CFLs in order to reduce energy usage for lighting purposes. Third component of the project is pre-payment meters. This component would be a pilot program to introduce pre-payment meters among the main consumer categories, particularly those from whom collection rates are low. The target is to introduce some 5,500 pre-payment meters at customer premises out of about 18,000 customers. Priority would be given to the 5,000 customers who currently have no meters. This would enable Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA) to improve its cash flow, in order to start maintaining its infrastructure. Fourth component of the project is loss reduction program. This component will focus on replacing these old low-voltage distribution lines in six Bangui neighborhoods with PVC insulated aluminum cables, where technical losses are lower and theft of electricity is much more difficult, and on equipping existing and new transformers to improve the quality of service. Fifth and the final component of the project is Agence d 'Exicution des Travaux d 'Interet Public (AGETIP-CAF).

The proceeds of this loan are to be used by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) of Sri Lanka to purchase power \ngenerators, turbines and other machinery and equipment (manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and \nMitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.) from Mitsubishi Corporation, as it undertakes rehabilitation of the old Ukuwela \nPower Station (19MW x 2) in the central province of Sri Lanka. \n \n3. Sri Lanka has seen a sharp increase in its power demand in recent years spurred by a robust 6.3% economic \ngrowth on average in recent years from 2003 to 2006.  Thus securing a stable power supply is high on the agenda \nof its power sector.  Meanwhile, the Ukuwela Hydro Power Station, a stable supply source of electricity since it was \nbuilt in 1976, has become decrepit, resulting in a fall in operational efficiency.  The power station is thus facing an \nincreasing risk of breakdown and suspension of operations.  Under these circumstances, this loan is aimed at not \nonly supporting the power sector in Sri Lanka, but also maintaining and improving the international competitiveness \nof the Japanese industry in trade transactions.

   "(1) Background and necessity of the Project\nSri Lanka's Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (2002-2016) estimates that peak demand in 2008, when this project is scheduled to begin operations, will reach 2,346 MW (actual demand in 2000 was 1,404 MW). The plan thus calls for a total facility capacity of 2,909 MW (actual capacity as of 2000 was 1,777 MW) to be secured by 2008.\nAccording to the plan, the installation of hydropower plants will provide an additional 220 MW of electricity, of which 70 MW will be provided by the Kukule Hydro Power Plant (ODA yen loan provided in July 1994), and 150 MW will be provided by this project.\nMost of Sri Lanka's hydropower resources have already been developed, making this project the last of the new large-scale hydropower plant projects. To expand Sri Lanka's power-generating capacity and to ensure a stable power supply that is not affected by the weather, there are plans to direct efforts toward the development of thermal power generation and thus to shift to a more balanced structure of electric power generation. However, since Sri Lanka is a country that lacks its own sources of fuel, it is important that it fully develop its hydropower sources, and this project is highly necessary for achieving this goal.\n(2) Purposes and description of the Project\nIn the Philippines, roads provide the principal means of transport, accounting for around 90% of the movement of people and approximately 50% of the transportation of goods. Looking at the current state of roads in the Philippines, the national arterial roads -- the key part of the road network -- and the national secondary roads (roads linking arterial roads with regional cities, towns, and villages) have been relatively well maintained overall on the quantitative (distance) side with investment up to the start of the 1980's concentrated on road extensions. However, many unpaved roads and decrepit simple emergency bridges still remain. Permanent bridges, too, are crumbling, breaking down, and deteriorating due to such factors as inadequate maintenance, the increase in overloaded vehicles and traffic volume, and the effect of natural disasters. With disasters like frequent typhoons prevalent, the road network is also in danger of severance as bridges are washed away or collapse. Because of these factors, the local regions lack a safe and efficient road network. The improvement of qualitative conditions is urgently needed, including the paving of unpaved roads and replacement of emergency bridges with permanent ones. To promote the interchange of people and distribution of goods within the nation and support the development of urban regions, the Philippines urgently requires the development of a safe and efficient arterial road network.\nBy replacing a total of 201 aged bridges on national roads that lead to urban centers all over the country, this project aims to contribute to safe and efficient distribution, and in turn, support the development of regional economies.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used for civil works and consulting services (detailed design, assistance in procurement, etc.).\nThe executing agency is the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) (Address: Bonifacio Drive, Port Area, Manila, Philippines, Phone: 63-2-304-3804, Fax: 63-2-304-3805).",

   "6732  On July 27, 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee of $5.3 million to World Power Holdings Luxembourg S.à.r.l. (WPH), an affiliate of Sithe Global (USA), covering their additional equity investment in the Bujagali hydropower project. In 2007, MIGA issued a guarantee  of $115 million covering WPH’s initial investment in the project. The investor has increased its equity investment due to additional costs associated with the project. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract. This additional coverage brings MIGA’s gross exposure under the project to $120.3 million.\nThe project consists of the construction and operation of a 250 megawatt, run-of-the-river hydropower plant on the Victoria Nile by Bujagali Energy Ltd. (BEL), of which WPH is a partner. The project was developed on a build-own-operate-transfer basis and reuses water flowing from two existing upstream facilities to generate electricity. The first generating unit was commissioned in February 2012 and the project reached full capacity in June 2012. The project also includes an associated Interconnection Project, which consists of a series of transmission lines to be owned and operated by the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company.\nReliable and accessible electricity is critical for Uganda’s social and economic development. Daily power shortages have stunted economic growth by an estimated one percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The Bujagali project has increased supply to the national power grid and reduced the need for more costly thermal power..\n\nIn addition to MIGA’s guarantee, the World Bank Group is supporting the project with $130 million in loans from the IFC and a partial risk guarantee of up to $115 million from the International Development Association. MIGA’s guarantee was essential to securing Sithe Global’s investment.",

The coverage is for a period of 13 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations.\nThe project involves the construction of a second powerhouse with four additional turbine generators with a total additional capacity of 700 megawatts on the basis of an engineering, procurement, and construction contract awarded to Odebrecht SA of Brazil. The Cambambe plant is one of two hydroelectric power stations currently in operation on the Kwanza River. The project is part of a larger rehabilitation and expansion program being undertaken by the government of Angola, under which the country’s generation capacity is set to increase from around 1,500 megawatts to over 5,000 megawatts.\nAfter decades of underinvestment into the power sector, Angola suffers from chronic electricity shortages that are hampering the country’s economic development. A recent government policy document, “Policy and National Energy Security Strategy” estimated that only 30 percent of the population has access to the power distribution network.  Electricity from this project will offer an economic and efficient means of increasing the electricity supply. Rebuilding and improving critical infrastructure is a pillar of the World Bank’s strategy for Angola’s development. The project is also aligned with MIGA’s strategic priorities of supporting investments in complex infrastructure projects as well as in countries affected by conflict.",

Due to the dry weather conditions, the Cochabamba Valley has historically faced a water supply problem aggravated by the population growth in the region. On the other hand, the country needs to increase its generation capacity preferably from renewable sources. The whole project comprises the construction of a 120-m high rock filled and concrete face dam, a 20km tunnel for water diversion (finalized in 2005 with the financial support from the Government of Italy), a pressurized piping system (from 3.700 to 2.700 meters above sea level) that conveys a controlled water flow from the tunnel to the power plant to be built in the Cochabamba Valley. The dam construction contract ($85 million) has been awarded and the financing is in place. The works for the hydroelectric power plant, including complementary investments such as a substation and a transmission line, estimated in about $114.1 million, will be financed with a loan from the IDB.

The \nobjectives are to alleviate the currently tight supply and demand situation of power in the Java-Bali \nGrid and to increase the stability of supply. This, in turn, is expected to contribute to the \ndevelopment of the Java economy by improving the investment climate. Moreover, the use of \nrenewable energy is expected to contribute to relieving impact on the global environment. The loan \nwill cover engineering services related to aspects such as the detailed design for the project, with \nthe objective of the smooth implementation and promotion of the project. \nPeak demand in the Java-Bali System, where the project is located, is 14,053 MW (actual demand \nfor 2003), and this is expected to reach 24,319 MW by 2013, with an average annual growth rate \nof about 5.6%. However, the capacity of the generating facilities in the grid is 18,658 MW (actual \ncapacity in 2003). Supply capacity in 2012, the year when the Kamojang Geothermal Power Plant \nextension is scheduled to commence operations, is projected to be 27,021 MW, taking into account \noperational stoppages caused by the aging of existing facilities and progress in the development of \nnew power sources. Therefore, the power supply reserve ratio for that same year is expected to fall to 17.9%, so the development of new power sources is an urgent matter. Moreover, the project, \nwhich will utilize renewable geothermal energy resources, is in line with the global trend toward \nenergy and environmental conservation. \nLoan funds will be allocated to consulting services (detailed design (including exploratory test well \ndrilling), assistance with tendering, and surveys (including exploratory test well drilling) of the \nLumutbalai geothermal field. \nProject Executing Agency \nPT PLN (Persero) \nAddress: Jl.

The loan is one of the cornerstones of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY08-11 which fully integrates the Bank's activities for FY08-11 into the Government's ninth development plan. Measures undertaken by the Turkish administration and supported under the program are expected to contribute to sustaining the growth experienced by Turkey since 2002, generating employment, supporting the competitiveness of Turkish industry, and improving the living standards of its people. The program carries several risks. From the macroeconomic side, Turkey faces economic challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. In particular, high external financing needs, mainly in the private sector, make Turkey vulnerable to persisting international illiquidity and capital outflows. While a single-party Government with a strong parliamentary majority creates a favorable environment for reform, some political risks to the program remain, including: (i) continuing domestic political differences; and (ii) geopolitical events in neighboring regions. On the program side, all PEDPL-1 supported reforms have been implemented, and the risk of reversal is low. However, there are sector specific risks: delays in implementation of the remaining envisaged reforms, delays in attracting private investment, slow progress of energy efficiency measures contributing to continuing high electricity demand growth, and external developments that result in the policy actions failing to achieve a significant level of improvement in the electricity supply demand imbalance",

The additional financing of US$15 million equivalent for the EERAP is being prepared in response to a Tajik Government request to International Development Association (IDA) to provide support for meeting severe energy shortages. The EERAP will be restructured with level two restructuring to address changed circumstances and the new challenges such as Tajikistan's cut off from Central Asia Power System (CAPS) and consequent needs to increase domestic power generation. The EERAP aims to: (a) ensure basic access to electricity for about 250,000 people in northern Tajikistan, and (b) increase heat and power supply to the entire country, without overdrawing or depleting hydro resources in winter. The additional financing will help finance costs associated with the following original project's activities: (i) scale-up of project activities to provide critically needed power; and (ii) a corresponding scale-up of project management support. A scale-up of the EERAP is appropriate because it supports project development objectives and aligns with the 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n\nIn response to the 2007-08 crisis, the Government developed the Energy Emergency Mitigation Action Plan (EEMAP); its objectives were to (a) sustain thermal and heat energy \nsupply in the shortest possible timeframe; (b) initiate preparations for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 winters, when energy supply remained in deficit; and (c) identify medium- and long-term actions to be implemented to improve energy security. The Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance \nProject (EERAP) helped implement elements of EEMAP, which is now almost complete, and has met its objectives. However, Government is revising EEMAP. Suggested measures include: (a) rapid construction of transmission lines to link areas unconnected to the Tajik energy grid; (b) procure more power from IPPs, such as Sangtuda-1; (c) improve Nurek hydro reservoir management; (d) enhance efforts to reduce \nlosses, and (e) improve demand-side management by using more energy-saving technologies.

In addition, the transmission line along the corridor will have the capacity to connect around other 6,000 new consumers if additional financing becomes available. (2) Construction of facilities for off-loading, transport, and storage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and support for optimization of HFO procurement component will support the government's decision to replace current expensive diesel-based generation with less costly HFO-based thermal generation. There are both physical and commercial aspects to optimizing the supply of fuel. Firstly, more reliable HFO supply will require physical investments in HFO off-loading, transport and storage facilities. Secondly, it requires improving HFO procurement practices. (3) Support for the expansion of supply options and for the strengthening of the sector's institutional capacity component will support the overall strengthening of Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy?s institutional capacity to plan and implement electricity access programs.",

In March 2005, Umeme was awarded a 20 year concession to manage and operate the assets of Uganda Electricity Distribution Company (UEDCL). The award of the concession was part of Uganda’s broader privatization of its power sector, which also involved the unbundling of transmission, distribution and generation, and the awarding of concessions for the operation of its existing generation assets. Uganda’s power sector privatization was fully supported by the World Bank Group, and the Umeme financing structure includes both MIGA insurance and a partial risk guarantee from IDA.\n\nTo date, Umeme has invested about $44 million in rehabilitating and developing its network, making additional connections, implementing a new customer billing system, and rolling out a customer call center and work management centers. Subject to the Ugandan regulator’s approval, Umeme intends to spend a further $50 million in the next two years (the “Project”). This investment is a continuation of the existing program, covering renewal of its asset base, loss reduction, network extension, and new connections (in addition to the 93,821 Umeme has already made).\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $50 million, of which $20 million would be funded in the form of an A loan and $5 million in the form of equity or C loan from IFC.

JBIC will also collaborate with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for transferring Total Quality Management (TQM) to support the executing agency in improving operational efficiency.\nReflecting robust economic growth, peak power demand in Bangladesh is projected to increase at an annual rate of 8-10% in the foreseeable future. Even today, the country's substations and transmission lines are overloaded and many areas are forced to limit power supplies with rolling blackouts. While the government has constructed new substations and expanded the existing substations and transmission lines, capital investment is not catching up with sharply rising demand.\nIn particular, power demand in such major cities as Dhaka, Comilla and Chittagong, as well as their surrounding areas, is expected to exceed transmission capacity by a wide margin in the matter of a few years. Frequent power outages and seriously low voltages in these areas, where many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are operating, will have an especially adverse impact on their business activities because SMEs cannot afford their own power generators. Therefore, a reliable, high-quality power supply is indispensable for underpinning economic growth, and power grids have to be developed fast and adequately to meet the ever-increasing power demand.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used for the procurement of transformers and related equipment to construct and expand substations, as well as transmission lines and towers.\nExecuting agency: Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd\nAddress: Red Crescent Concord Tower (6th Floor) 17, Mohakhali C/A Dhaka—1212, Bangladesh\nTel: 880-2-9890938 Fax: 880-2-9888501",

Due to the increase in the number of office buildings and factories and the growth in the population, demand for power has risen by an annual average of 7% since 2001, and is forecast to rise by an annual average of 11% over the next five years. An increase in power supply capacity in the state is being promoted rapidly through the construction of power plants, and upgrading the capacity of the transmission network for the city and the neighboring area is an urgent task in order to supply the sharply rising amount of power being generated to consumers in a stable manner.\n(b) Project Objectives and Outline\nThe project aims to contribute to the economic development of the region and an improvement in living standards through the upgrading of power supply capacity by establishing a high voltage transmission network in the city of Hyderabad and the neighboring area. With the implementation of the project, the processing capacity of substations within the target area is planned to increase by about 40%. Moreover, a decline in transmission loss rates and a decrease in the number of power outages are also expected.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used for the procurement of equipment for transmission lines and substation, civil engineering, and consulting services.\nProject Executing Agency\nTransmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (AP Transco)\nAddress: Vidyut Soudha, Khairatabad, Hyderabad 500 082, Andhra Pradesh, India\nTel: +91-40-2331-7650\nFax: +91-40-2339-6023",

   "The Kurdistan region, consisting of the three northern governorates of Duhok, Erbil and Sulamaniah, receives its electricity supply primarily from two hydropower plants in the region and the national power grid. However, due to lack of new investment and insufficient operation and maintenance, electricity supply to the region has gradually decreased from an average of 700 megawatts (MW) in 1991 to 400 MW in 2006. This has met only 40% of power demands for household use, and, as a result, power outages last more than 12 hours a day on average. The power supply thus remains unreliable and unstable for households and basic infrastructure facilities such as hospitals. While other donors have provided their assistance mainly for power generation/transmission systems in the Kurdistan region, there still has been a lack of support for substation and distribution sectors. Given that a significant decline in the capacity of substations and distribution facilities is one of the causes of the deteriorating electricity supply in the region, there is an urgent need to rehabilitate and develop these facilities.\nThe objective of the project is to improve the levels of reliability and availability of the electricity network in the Kurdistan region by developing substation and distribution sectors.\nJBIC signed the project agreement in October 2007 with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has maintained an operational base in the region to conduct reconstruction assistance and has had much field experience of assisting the electricity sector reconstruction and development in the Kurdistan region for years, for capacity building and procurement assistance services for this project. Through this service, JBIC will proactively promote preparation for efficient implementation of this project.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be applied to the procurement of machinery and equipment for substation and distribution networks, and relevant consulting services.\nProject executing agency: Regional Ministry of Electricity in Kurdistan (RMEK)\nAddress: 16 Street, Erbil, Iraq",

   "(1) Haryana Transmission System Project\n(a) Project Background and Necessity\nThe concentration of industry in Haryana is rapidly progressing with a large number of overseas companies, including about 60 from Japan advancing into the region, in places such as the capital Delhi's neighboring city Gurgaon. As a result, the quantity of electricity supplied to meet the rapidly increasing power demands is escalating, leading to a strain on transmission amounts at many facilities. Expansion of the transmission system has therefore become a pressing issue for providing a stable supply of electricity to consumers.\n(b) Project Objectives and Outline\nThe project focuses on the East of Haryana which includes the Gurgaon district and aims to ensure a stable supply of electricity to respond to the surging power demands. This will be achieved through the establishment of about 500km of new transmission lines and 14 new substations, upgrading the transmission network of the state and contributing to the economic development of the region and an increase in the standard of living.\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used for the procurement of transmission equipment and the installation work.\nProject Executing Agency: Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd.

Thus this project is classified as Category B. \n(iii) Environmental Permit \nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report related to the project’s transmission and \ndistribution portions was approved by the Ministry of Environment and Agriculture in May \n2006. For the power generation portions, the EIA report is currently in the approval process. \n(iv) Anti-Pollution Measures \nIn the project, the emission levels of atmospheric and water contaminants are expected to meet \nthe World Bank’s effluent standards. \n(v) Natural Environment \nThe project site is not located in or around sensitive areas, such as national parks, and so \nadverse impact on the natural environment is assumed to be minimal. \n(vi) Social Environment \nThe construction of transmission lines will require acquisition of 0.1 ha of land on which to \nbuild the foundation for an iron tower, which will be carried out in accordance with the \ndomestic procedures of Cape Verde. Resident relocation is not expected. \n(vii) Other/Monitoring \nSince the small-scale power generators currently running will be stopped when the project is \ncompleted, their impact on the environment is expected to be alleviated. The executing agency \nwill monitor the air quality and noise level.  \n(b) Promotion of Poverty Reduction \nSupport is expected to be provided for supplying power to households in poor districts in the \ncapital city of Praia and the surrounding area. \n(c) Promotion of Social Development (e.g. Gender Perspective, Measure for Infectious Diseases \nIncluding AIDS, Participatory Development, Consideration for the Handicapped, etc.)  \nThe project will ensure stable supply of drinking water and provision of power services to \neducational, health and other facilities; thus raising hopes of providing better social services to \nlocal residents.

In 2005, a drought resulted in significant power shortages, forcing frequent blackouts in the northern region, which is dependent on hydropower generation. In addition, the inadequate capacity of transmission and distribution networks has often caused such problems as transmission losses and unstable electric power supplies. It is thus important to create an efficient and stable power supply system, while developing new power sources. JBIC will support the Power Transmission and Distribution Network Development Project in which power transmission and distribution networks will be expanded and upgraded with a view to helping build a stable and efficient power supply system and thereby improve the investment climate in this region.",

   "(1) Electric Frontier Expansion Project (III)\n(a)\tBackground and Necessity\n\nIn Peru, approximately six million people, accounting 22 percent of the total population do not have access to electric?power network. This percentage rises to 68 percent in rural areas, a particularly marked disparity when compared to cities such as the capital of Lima, where more than 90 percent of the population has electrical access. Such areas without electricity connection must depend on batteries, kerosene lamps and candles for power and lighting, and even areas with electrical power have only expensive, unreliable service, restricting production activities and further causing poverty.\n\nSince 1993, the Peruvian government has actively worked on rural electrification projects and has set a target of providing service to 93.1 percent of the population by 2015. The regions of Cajamarca, Huánuco and Loreto have top priority for power infrastructures given that they have the lowest electrification rates and the highest poverty rates in the country.\n\n(b)\tObjective and Summary\n\nThe Electric Frontier Expansion Project (III) will improve the electrification rate in villages located in the regions of Cajamarca, Huánuco and Loreto—the regions with the lowest power access rates and highest poverty rates in Peru—through electrical distribution and transmission infrastructures. This will raise the standard of living in those areas as well as stimulate social and economic activities. JICA has thus far provided Japanese ODA loans totaling 2.3 billion yen for regions with sparse electrification, particularly in the mountainous areas. This project will be supported similarly as the third phase in this development.\n\nThis project will raise the rate of electrification in the target areas from around 50 percent to 70 percent, which is expected to improve the standard of living for residents.\n\nThe loan funds will be allocated to power distribution and transmission network improvements as well as consulting expenses for Cajamarca and Loreto Regions[1].\n\nExecuting agency:\nUnidad Ejecutora de Programas Regionales – PROREGION (the Executing Unit of Regional Programs of Cajamarca) \nAddress: Jr. Sta.

   "Energy Control System Upgrading Project in Upper Egypt\n(a) Background and Necessity\nThe Egyptian energy control system consists of a national energy control facility that controls 500kV and 220kV substations and power plants, and six regional energy control facilities that control substations below 132kV. UERCC (Upper Egypt Regional Control Center) is one of the six regional facilities, constructed with Japanese ODA Loan in 1988, it has controlled electricity transmission networks below 132kV across Upper Egypt (area along the Nile River south of Cairo) and backed up the operation of 220kV networks. However, the shortage of system capacity due to rapid expansion of electricity transmission networks as well as aging of the system is impeding its monitoring and other functions relating to the networks. Moreover, it has an out-of-date system that is no longer manufactured, spare parts are unavailable, proper and smooth operation has been becoming increasingly difficult, drastic renewal and expansion of equipment is an urgent necessity.\n\n(b) Objective and Project Summary\nThe purpose of this project is to renew the equipment of UERCC and to construct new MERCC (Middle Egypt Regional Control Center) to achieve more efficient and stable operation of electricity supply networks and to contribute to economic and social development in the region. \nThe Loan covers the provision of material and equipment, civil works, system building and consulting services.\n\nExecuting agency\nEgyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC)\nAddress: Abbassia-Nasr, City P.

The proposed development objectives of the Carbon Offset Project are: (i) Reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide; and (ii) Increase the efficiency, reliability, and quality of electricity supply in the local distribution system of PSEB.The proposed carbon offset project consists of replacement of the existing 3-phase 400V distribution system with an 11-kV high voltage distribution system in 19 of the 20 distribution circles in Punjab by Punjab State Electricity Board to reduce technical losses. PSEB’s overall\nlosses are currently reported to be 25.1 percent, of which approximately 18 percent are estimated to be due to technical reasons. The proposed project, consisting of 46 separate schemes, will reduce technical losses to 11 percent within a five year period, saving an estimated 490 GWh per\nyear once fully commissioned. Project financing has been secured from Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), and implementation is expected to begin in the summer of 2007. PSEB will decommission a large number of existing low capacity/voltage transformers and will install new 6.3-, 10-, and 16-kVA transformers to convert to a higher voltage distribution system. New power lines will not be installed as part of this project.",

Also, the study intends to clearly identify and differentiate the missions and responsibilities of the different authorities, so as to avoid inefficiencies and overlap. In particular, in relation to ANP (the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) and PPSA (Pré-Sal Petróleos SA, the sub-salt company) the study should consider a transition phase, where ANP will act as PPSA. Thus, the study should suggest what would be the decision-making processes and the major administrative tasks that should be incorporated into ANP which will subsequently be transferred to PPSA.These objectives are consistent with the country strategy in two key areas: (a) productivity and infrastructure ... to use public-private partnership models in new investments ... and (b) modernization of the state and institutional strengthening (as contained in the document GN-2570 of May 4, 2010).",

Project Description: The proposed Natural Resources Management Development Policy Loan aims to improve the efficiency of natural resources management in Gabon, to increase its impact on poverty alleviation, to protect the environment, and to reduce the country's dependence on declining oil resources. It covers renewable natural resources-forests, fisheries, biodiversity and environment-as well as the country's mining (mostly manganese) and oil sectors. With regard to forest, fisheries, biodiversity and environment, the proposed loan will support the reform agenda set forth in the May 2004 letter of Sector Policy which will be implemented through the national multi-donor Forest, Fisheries, Biodiversity and Environment Sector Program (FESP). The proposed loan will also support Gabon's participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) for oil and mining revenues, and it will lay the foundation for broader reforms in the mining sector. Policies supported by the proposed loan focus on enhancing transparency, accountability and law enforcement, on improving the business climate, on ensuring equitable sharing of revenues, and on protecting the resource-base and natural ecosystems. The beneficiaries are the Gabon Planning and Monitoring Unit and the Ministry of Forest and Environment.",

The overarching objective of the DPL operation is to balance socio-economic development with environmental protection and improvement. The operation will complement actions supported by the recently approved climate change DPL and will further pursue the general objectives of a previous Environment DPL Program, by integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies and programs of key development sectors: tourism, energy, forestry, water, agriculture, and housing as prioritized by the government of Mexico (GOM). The original Environment DPL Program supported environmental mainstreaming in four of these sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, and water); the other two (agriculture and housing) have been included at the GOM's request. Macroeconomic risks are associated with effects on the Mexican economy of: (i) a sharper slowdown of the US (and global) economy, decelerating growth of non-oil exports and reducing the flow of workers' remittances, (ii) higher levels of international commodity and food prices leading to further pressures on domestic inflation, (iii) increased uncertainty with respect to credit conditions for the access of emerging markets to the international capital markets, and (iv) declining oil production. However, several factors are in place to reduce these risks, including: a healthy financial system that has begun to expand domestic credit as a share of GDP; more dynamism in exports to non-US destinations; favorable terms of trade with high oil prices; and the further consolidation of prudent macroeconomic policies in both the fiscal and monetary realms.",

The project will accomplish this by helping REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and economic agents. The project will be comprised of three components: (i) the electricity component, which will support urgent investments to rehabilitate the electricity supply system and reduce the supply/demand gap; (ii) the water component, which will support short-term investments to increase access to water supply, reduce losses and reinforce the capacity of the supply and distribution system; and (iii) the institutional component, which will support the strengthening of the capacities of both REGIDESO and MWEM. A quantitative analysis of costs and benefits of the Bujumbura water supply investment program yielded a net present value (calculated with a 12 percent discount rate) of US$0.7 million. The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the urban water supply program is estimated at 13.0 percent.

The objectives of the Energy Sector Development Policy Operation Program are to contribute to reducing Tonga's fiscal deficit and to support the Government's efforts in implementing reforms in the energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and stable growth in the medium term. The program will provide budget support to reduce the near-term fiscal deficit. It will also reinforce the importance of implementation of energy sector reforms necessary to reduce Tonga's vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks, which otherwise will pose a significant risk to achieving stable growth in the medium term. Like other Pacific Island nations, Tonga is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and to external economic shocks because of its small size combined with a large distance from the nearest large market. The knock-on effects of the global economic crisis, in particular in remittances and tourism revenues, contributed to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contractions of 0.4 percent in FY2008-09 and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009-10. As the government recognized the extent to which its tax revenues had been affected by the global economic crisis last year, it took emergency measures to limit recurrent expenditures including imposing lower ceilings on the expenditures in most ministries toward the end of FY2009-2010. It also sought budget support in the form of grants from donors. While the outlook is for growth to recover in FY2010-2011 to around 1.5 to 2 percent, downside risks remain. Containing expenditure to the level set in the budget will be challenging, even with greater attention to expenditure prioritization, given the emergency-nature of the budget cuts already instituted in FY2009-10.

The financial support granted to Togo would help implement the country’s economic reform agenda, and would further narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key elements of the country’s poverty reduction strategy and resources available from the Government’s own revenues and other donor support. The World Bank’s Board of Directors today approved a grant amounting to US$28 million for the Republic of Togo to support the implementation of the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-4).  This operation aims to support the implementation of economic governance reforms initiated under previous economic recovery operations granted respectively in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Most specifically, the ERGG-4 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial management and governance of key sectors of the economy. In this regard, the new operation would put an emphasis on two main pillars i.e.: (i) the strengthening of governance with the aim of improving budget formulation, execution and controls, and public procurement; and (ii) the consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth including through reforms in the phosphate, cotton and energy sectors. The reforms supported by the new operation are critical to the Government’s ability to use public resources efficiently and effectively to support the country’s economic and social recovery.  The approval of ERGG-4 is based on a set of prior actions in the following areas: (1) Public financial management: (i) preparation of draft decrees and laws to implement the six West African Economic Monetary Union directives pertaining to public finances; (ii) publication of the 2010 quarterly budget execution reports and submission to Parliament, of the draft 2011 budget law with a medium-term expenditure framework for each of the education, health and agriculture sectors; (iii) adoption of a  treasury management planning order; (iv) submission by the SOTOCO’s  liquidator, CEET SNPT and Togo Télécom of their respective 2007 and 2008 financial statements to the Court of Accounts; and (v) development and operation of the procurement website, and publication and circulation of the Procurement Newspaper. (2) Cotton sector: (i) the implementation of an analytical accounting system for new cotton company NSCT which is consistent with the recommendations of the Assessment Report; and (ii) the provision of training to farmer leaders toward a better participation within the NSCT board.  The objectives are to improve the financial management of NSCT, and to strengthen farmers’ representational abilities on the Board of NSCT to ensure their participation in the decision-making process. (3) Phophate sector: adoption of a detailed action plan and budget for the activities that are to be implemented under EITI-Togo; the objective is to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability, thus contributing to greater private sector and donor confidence.\n(4) Energy sector: adoption of the Utility Tariffs Adjustment Order. This prior action will contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of CEET as it passes-through to the consumers the tariff adjustment that CEB made in June 2009.\nUpon approval of the project, Madani M. Tall, Country Director for Togo, commended the Togolese government for all the efforts made to implement the prior actions for the new budget support operation, These efforts have led to the consolidation of reforms initiated in 2008 with our first budget support operation.  We strongly believe that the ERGG-4 will help continue the implementation of the country’s reform agenda to support the economic and social recovery, and help address the institutional and economic challenges”. Tall also commended government for efforts made to achieved the HIPC Completion point, and encourage them to pursue and intensify the reforms already started, in order to fully enjoy the benefits of the debt relief, i.e. having more facility to mobilize the resources necessary to achieve growth and reduce poverty. The program is aligned with the World Bank Interim Strategy for Togo, and also with Togo’s poverty reduction strategy.  It is closely coordinated with other World Bank programs for Togo, and with the International Monetary Fund’s ECF program. The Togolese Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for implementing the grant, which will be released in a single tranche.  (Power 20%).",

The program responds to an urgent request by the Government of Malawi (GoM) to support the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program as well as measures which will mitigate the impacts of the wide range of reforms which are being currently implemented. Some of the key economic reforms include liberalizing Malawi's foreign exchange regime and significant fuel and power price adjustments to better cover costs of these essential commodities. The program is aligned with the ongoing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and is also consistent with new World Bank Group CAS for Malawi (FY13-16) which is at an advanced stage of preparation.\n\nWorld Bank states 29% of $50 million grant goes towards oil and gas.",

The operation is the second in a programmatic series of two development policy operations. The operation will be financed by International Development Association (IDA) resources of US$1.8 million and Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0 million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank's operation being approved. The operation will help the Government of Tonga manage severe economic challenges that have coincided with historic political reforms. It supports a focused program of Government reform priorities in public financial management, fiscal policy, and business environment reforms while providing a vital fiscal buffer in the context of sustained revenue contraction.  \n\nUnder fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on strengthening revenue effort to maintain delivery of public services following substantial revenue declines. Actions in this area include policy decisions to introduce small business and natural resource tax regimes and measures to increase transparency of the costs of tax exemptions.",

The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has begun to implement a strategy to place the power sector on a more sustainable path. The discovery of important offshore natural gas reserves presents Tanzania with a potentially transformational opportunity for the country. The Government is determined to, and has started the process of, implementing an appropriate policy framework for the optimal use of future natural gas revenues. A programmatic approach is being proposed to support the Government in addressing the above challenges. The operation is consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY12-15 and the Africa regional strategy. The development objective of the program is to: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in its power sector; (ii) reduce the cost of power supply and to promote private sector participation in the power sector; and (iii) to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's natural gas resources",

The project has five components, with multiple sub-components. Component A is petroleum policy and legal framework. This component has two sub-components: (A1) petroleum policy and strategy to maximize value arising from natural gas development (financial, social, and environmental); and (A2) the legal and regulatory framework for the gas subsector reflects the Government´s policies and strategies for this sub-sector and therein, attracts foreign and local investments. Component B is strengthening institutional sector management, coordination and governance. This component has four sub-components: (B1) strengthening sector coordination and governance; (B2) enhancing organizational capacity; (B3) environmental and social management; and (B4) health and safety management. Component C is education and skills development. This component addresses the increase in availability of vocational training capacity for the gas sub-sector of Tanzania in alignment with the projection of employment growth in the public and private parts of the sub-sector. Component D is power generation and natural gas PPP projects capacity building. This component has two sub-components: (D1) Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEM) PPP node support; and (D2) Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) PPP node support. Component E is project coordination. This component supports the Project Steering Committee as well as the Project Management Teams (PMT) of the four Implementing Agencies (IAs), namely MEM, TANESCO, Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA). It will enhance the IAs capacity for procurement and financial management, through the provision of technical advisory services, training, operating costs, acquisition of goods and a vehicle for the MEM project coordinator.\n\nCanada: Canadian International Development Agency (Cida): $13,540,000 and IDA: 21,460,000",

This is a partnership between Abu Dhabi's national oil company and Japan's development bank.  \n \nAbu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and loan agreement valued up to US $3 billion dollars in Abu Dhabi on November 2, 2010.\n\nH.E. Yousef Omair bin Yousef, Secretary General of the Supreme Petroleum Council and ADNOC CEO, and Mr. Hiroshi Watanabe, JBIC President and CEO, conducted the signing at a ceremony in the presence of Mr. \nYoshikatsu Nakayama, Japan’s Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry that took place at the Shaikh Khalifa Energy Complex. \n\nThe signed MOU aims to further strengthen the comprehensive and strategic partnership already established between ADNOC and JBIC in a previous MOU signed in April 2007.\n\nThe objective is to mutually recognize the granting of new concessions to Japanese entities and to renew existing concessions involving Japanese entities, which are important goals within JBIC's mandate and thereby further strengthen a comprehensive and strategic partnership between JBIC and ADNOC. \n\nFurthermore, the US $3 billion loan agreement was co-financed with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (lead arranger), Mizuho Corporate Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, BNP Paribas, Tokyo Branch and Citibank Japan. \n\nADNOC, a Government of Abu Dhabi state-run and owned company, conducts oil and gas business in the Emirate \nof Abu Dhabi and owns most of the oil and gas reserves and production facilities in UAE.  \n\nThe UAE is an important country for Japan’s resource strategy since it has been a stable source of crude oil to Japan for more than 30 years.  The UAE is one of the few countries that allows foreign oil companies to participate in the upstream segment based on concession agreements. Further strengthening the relationship with ADNOC will support the grant of new concessions and renewal of existing ones involving Japanese entities, therefore contributing to a stable \nsupply of energy resources to Japan.  \n\nJapan’s Basic Energy Plan, revised in June this year, recognized “strengthening bilateral ties with the countries endowed with natural resources” as a concrete effort to secure a stable supply of oil resources.  The signing of this MOU and loan agreement are aligned with the Japanese government energy policy.  \n\nIt will strengthen bilateral ties between Japan and the resource-endowed country, which is strategically important to Japan.",

It is expected that half of the investments will be located outside Nigeria, in smaller IDA countries. The Fund will target the following sectors: financial services, telecoms, healthcare, power and utilities, transport and logistics, agro-business and consumer products. It is expected that 50% of the Fund’s commitments will be invested in infrastructure-related projects including power, railway and telecom infrastructure. The Fund will make 8-10 investments with an average investment size of US$50 million (investments may range from US$20 million to US$100 million).

These include thermal (fueled by natural gas, diesel, fuel oil and coal), wind, solar, and hydro types of power generation. CG also owns and operates small captive energy generation facilities on-site for commercial beverage bottling companies worldwide. IFC’s proposed loan of up to $150mm and syndication of up to $100mm for a total of $250mm would support future CG growth through a combination of greenfield engineering and construction and acquisition of existing facilities. The use of proceeds would be restricted to IFC countries of operation and will exclude any investment in coal-fired power plants. Opportunities for greenfield projects consist of wind, hydro, and solar power in South America and Africa; thermal power in Africa, and thermal power in Southeastern Europe. Potential acquisitions include opportunities in Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nCG is planning to invest an average ~US$650 million over the next three years as the acquisition and development projects in its pipeline reach financial close. This will be financed by IFC’s loan as well as from dividends from its existing operating companies.",

The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on September \n29 (U.S.time) a loan agreement in the aggregate amount of up to 750 million US dollars with MT Falcon Holdings \nCompany, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (MT Falcon), a Mexican firm where Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (“Mitsui”) and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. \n(“TGC”) have equity stakes to finance the acquisition of a portfolio of power assets in Mexico.  The loan, provided in \nproject financing,*2 was cofinanced with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and \nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, with JBIC providing political risk guarantee for the portion financed by these \nprivate financial institutions. \n \n2. The purpose of the loan is to provide financial support for the acquisition of a portfolio of power assets owned by a \nSpanish company, Gas Natural, and their long term operation and maintenance by MT Falcon.  The target assets \nconsists of five independent power producers (IPPs)*3 owning five power stations (combined total power generation \ncapacity: 2,233 MW) located in northeastern Mexico, a gas pipeline company, and another associated company. \nThis is portfolio-oriented project financing to be repaid by revenues of the multi-IPPs generated by selling electricity \nto the off-taker, Federal Electricity Commission (Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE)), a state-owned power \ncompany in Mexico.  \n \n3. In Mexico, President Felipe Calderón launched the National Infrastructure Program*4 in 2007, which focuses on \ninvestments in infrastructure projects.  In the power sector, the Program set out an expansion of power generation \ncapacity of 9,000 MW by 2012.  It is thus expected that new IPP-style power generation projects will be planned in \nthe coming years. \n \n4. Given this circumstance, it is expected that supporting the acquisition of power assets by Mitsui and TGC with this \nloan and guarantee will encourage Japanese firms to increase their presence in Mexico's power market, and that \nthis loan and guarantee will help Japanese firms promote their participation in infrastructure projects, including \npower generation projects and the acquisition of interests in IPP projects. \n \n5. JBIC will support overseas infrastructure projects undertaken by Japanese firms by performing its function, \nemploying a range of facilities and schematic arrangements.",

   "IDB project GY-L1037. Experience in many parts of the world demonstrates that it is possible to reduce losses in a reasonably short period of time by carrying out energy audits, prioritizing the results and focusing on high loss areas. Energy accounting helps in devising a systematic plan for handling losses in the system. Ignoring energy audits can prove detrimental in the fight against losses.Overall, losses need to be analyzed in term of non-technical (commercial) and technical losses. It is recommended that the reduction of technical losses be included in the Strategic Loss Reduction Plan of the Utility. The new Loss Reduction Unit (LRU) is responsible for the monitoring of losses in the system and gives support in the implementation of new actions. Additional investments can help to maintain the operation of effective actions to bring down losses to acceptable levels; commercial and technical. Acceptable levels for technical losses depend on various factors: configuration of the network, physical parameters of the network, level of loading, prevalent operating voltage level etc. The acceptable technical power loss levels are in the range of 8.0% to 15.0%. The LRU reported 21.6% of commercial losses and 12% of technical losses in the Utility. Some measures to reduce technical losses can be implemented in the short-term 1-2 years and in the long-term 2-3 years. Some of these measures are: network reconfiguration, network reconductoring, load balancing, relocation of distribution transformers at load centers, augmentation of distribution transformers, addition of new distribution transformers, regular maintenance of distribution network etc. This operation along with current efforts from the Utility to curb commercial losses in a Strategic Loss Reduction Program, will contribute to reflect the impact of specific actions to bring down losses. The estimated total cost of this project is $5,000,000.",

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5°C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations. DPO2 was designed in close coordination with SP-RCC co-financiers as a continuation of DPO1.\n\nWB reports 30% of $70 million for energy efficiency.",

The components of the project include: the project concept was designed to provide an integrated technical and financial analysis of end-use projects to be financed by Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). To avoid lengthy and cumbersome application processes for projects that commercial banks will not be interested in financing, the National Agency for Energy Control (ANME) will work closely with PFIs to prescreen projects for financing. This set-up will also allow the integration of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (FNME) subsidies and other grants and loans from different sources in the financing plan of each project, therefore avoiding that projects do not reach financial close because of lack of one of the components of the financing plan. Technical assistance might be useful to complement lines of credit to provide support to Financial Intermediaries (FIs), Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and developers of sub-projects. However, ANME already has very strong capabilities and resources allowing it to provide the support required to PFIs in the area of business planning and sub-project evaluation. It also already benefits from technical assistance from various sources that aim at supporting skill enhancement or capacity building in matters related to financing of Energy Efficiency (EE) activities. Finally, a strong pipeline of identified sub-projects already exists. Should other sources of financing eventually arise for complementary technical assistance, the latter will mainly focus on: (a) training and capacity building of the commercial banks in the area of energy efficiency and cogeneration; (b) providing support to project developers to assist in the preparatory studies and business development assistance including technical and financial feasibility studies; and (c) support for targeted awareness and training efforts to support pipeline development efforts.",

This Energy Efficiency Development Policy Loan is aimed at transitioning Poland to a low-emissions economy, “while maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with the European Union (EU)-15 and do this within a constrained fiscal environment.” \n\nPoland currently uses its abundant coal reserves to meet more than 90 percent of its electricity needs. In an analysis of the country’s carbon abatement potential by the World Bank and Government of Poland, energy efficiency and selected renewable energy investments were identified as priority near- to medium-term investments. Although energy efficiency options are low cost, market penetration has been limited. \n\nThis Development Policy Loan (DPL) supports policy actions that are designed to address market rigidities. Poland has established a target that by 2020 renewable energy will account for 15 percent of final energy consumption. To support the implementation of its renewable energy policy, the government has established a green certificates program that obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of renewable energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies are available from EC funds used to help decrease renewable energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions.\n\nThe total cost of this project is $1,114,500,000.  (Sectors are listed as 83% for energy efficiency in power sector and 17% renewable energy.)\n\nEnergy efficiency: (i) reduced energy consumption in the supply side by increasing the share of cogeneration in power supply; (ii) acceleration of supply and demand-side EE measures by supporting the implementation of a smart metering program; and (iii) decreased energy consumption in the transport sector.",

The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract.\nThe project involves the conversion of the existing Azito Thermal Power Plant from simple-cycle to combined-cycle. This will include the addition of a steam turbine generator and heat recovery systems as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generator to the plant’s 225 kV substation. The project will add approximately 140 megawatts of installed capacity to the grid, without requiring any additional gas supply, for a total plant installed capacity of approximately 430 megawatts. Since the expansion from a simple-cycle to a combined-cycle plant was foreseen when the first phase of the project was completed in 1999, the related facilities and transmission line were designed to accommodate the full plant expansion and output.\nCôte d’Ivoire’s energy infrastructure suffers from lack of maintenance, system overload, and financial difficulties. Due to limited access, over three-quarters of households are dependent on cheap wood charcoal, though this has environmental and health costs in the long term. The project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for Côte d’Ivoire, which stresses the critical importance of building energy capacity to sustain economic progress.\n\nMIGA’s support for this investment is also aligned with the agency’s strategy of supporting investments into countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association, countries affected by conflict, and complex infrastructure projects.",

The new facility will build on the success of the original framework, continuing the good work that has been achieved with PBs and will especially target areas that remain underdeveloped, i.e. more complex refurbishment of larger dwellings as well as housing associations that have just received legal status.\n\nThe transition impact of the Project extension stems from the followings sources:\n\nExpansion and enhanced competition in the market for energy efficiency products and services - the stringent eligibility criteria under this facility will only allow installation of best available technology equipment thus creating a demand pull for more efficient equipment as well as quality suppliers/installers to compete for providing quality equipment and services, alongside other energy efficiency products, to the market.\nDemonstration of energy efficiency products in the market - the expanded Project will include higher standard equipments and expand towards more comprehensive building level refurbishments. Market penetration rates of specific eligible  techniques are close to zero and REECL financing will help to expand the market of technologies and associated services;\nDemonstration of intermediation with associations of apartment owners - refurbishments by associations can have a more comprehensive and larger scale impact on energy efficiency and emissions savings. However, Bulgarian banks are not yet confident and do not have experience with structuring lending to these newly established housing associations, that evidently lack credit history. The introduction of a loss risk cover mechanism and other incentives under the facility will help promote lending to associations of apartment owners and this targeted lending will help demonstrate the association’s viability as market participants. This will have a strong demonstration effect and may encourage other transactions in the area of energy efficiency with housing associations, or even in other sectors.",

The new facility will build on the success of the original framework, continuing the good work that has been achieved with PBs and will especially target areas that remain underdeveloped, i.e. more complex refurbishment of larger dwellings as well as housing associations that have just received legal status.\n\nThe transition impact of the Project extension stems from the followings sources:\n\nExpansion and enhanced competition in the market for energy efficiency products and services - the stringent eligibility criteria under this facility will only allow installation of best available technology equipment thus creating a demand pull for more efficient equipment as well as quality suppliers/installers to compete for providing quality equipment and services, alongside other energy efficiency products, to the market.\nDemonstration of energy efficiency products in the market - the expanded Project will include higher standard equipments and expand towards more comprehensive building level refurbishments.

Concerning PV, the electricity potential of electricity production is estimated at 720 GWh/year for the whole Province in public buildings and public land. This corresponds to a capacity of 530 MWp. Concerning energy efficiency projects, the operation will initially focus on street and traffic lighting. The associated energy savings are estimated at 270 and 10 GWh/year respectively. This operation will cover part of the investments in these areas in the period 2009-2011.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe development of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects supports national and European targets in these two areas and thus supports climate change and security of energy supply objectives of the EU. In particular, the project contributes to the objectives of the Covenant of Mayors initiative of the Commission, as over 60 municipalities of the Barcelona province have joined the Covenant. These municipalities have committed to reduce GHG emission by over 20% by 2020.",

However with ash build up and pileup operation efficiencies will go down and the plant can be shut down if the rehabilitation of the ash plant is not undertaken. The rehabilitation of the Ash Plant will therefore mitigate the ash build up hence ensure availability of the operating plants.

   "P118916   The development objective is to strengthen the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF) Project as a single window institution to appraise infrastructure Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects requiring government guarantees. There are two components to the project. The first component of the project is Word Bank (WB)-Supported IIGF Guarantees. The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA). The Project will provide a loan for TA in the amount of approximately $4.6 million to develop IIGF's institutional capacity to: screen, appraise and supervise IIGF-projects as a single window for all government guarantees for infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia; manage its operations; build capacity in Contracting Agencies (CAs), sponsors and other relevant parties; develop standardized documents and procedures for contracting agencies, sponsors and other relevant parties to use in preparing PPP projects and require the use of such documents and procedures in order for PPP projects to receive IIGF guarantees; and support PPP preparation activities, including feasibility studies, transaction advisory support and other activities\n\nOCI Note on Coal:  Given that the GOI’s Fast Track I power projects were predominantly coal plants, without significant changes to the Fast Track project list, it essentially dictated that WBG infrastructure assistance would further accelerate development of the coal industry. So far, the Fast Track I projects listed as “under development” include 40 coal power plants totaling 16.4 GW. In total, coal generation accounts for 94% of the Fast Track I generation capacity.  Moreover, the first project to receive an IIGF guarantee in October 2011 was the huge coal-powered Central Java Power Project (or Jawa Tengah Power Plant).  IIGF has also extended a guarantee to Puruk Cahu-Bangkuang Coal Railway, a US$3 billion, 385 km rail project to connect coal mines in northern Kalimantan to a port at Batanjung in southern Kalimantan.",

Project Status: The additional financing for Kosovo Lignite power technical assistance is to provide the Project Steering Committee with sufficient financing to execute the contracts with the successful bidders for the transaction advisory and the legal and regulatory advisory services, so that these advisors can assist the PSC in dealing with prospective private investors in a proposed multi-billion dollar lignite mining and power plant development (the New Minemew Plant) and in possible future energy sector developments. The original estimated budget for these two consultancies was US$4.60 million and the highest-scoring bids are US1.87 million over budget. Accordingly, the additional financing is necessary for the continuation of the project. Given the importance of this project in the Bank's portfolio in Kosovo and the role of the energy sector in providing economic stability for continued growth, the immediate hiring of these advisors is essential for the Bank's continuing support of the Kosovo provisional institutions of self-government.

The deposit, which was acquired by Ivanhoe from BHP Billiton in 2000, consists of a near surface (Southern Oyu) copper/gold orebody together with a high grade deposit (Hugo North) suitable for underground mining discovered in 2002. With resources of almost 80 billion pounds of copper and 45 million ounces of gold, Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest known copper/gold deposits. \n\n The Project is being developed in phases starting with construction of a copper concentrator and associated infrastructure to support production of 100,000 tonnes per day of ore, to be sourced predominantly from the Southern Oyu open pit mine development. In parallel underground infrastructure and mine development is ongoing for the Hugo North deposit. Commercial operations from the initial open pit mining development are expected to start in mid-2013. Underground production from Hugo North is expected to commence in 2016. A potential expansion of concentrator capacity (subject to required regulatory approvals and the identification and permitting of additional water resources) to 160,000 tonnes per day of ore, is currently being studied. Mine output, in the form of copper concentrate, will be trucked along a dedicated new road to the China border, to reach the Company’s primary target market of Chinese copper smelters. Power for the initial years of operations will be sourced from China, to be replaced by an on-site captive coal fired plant, which is currently in the advanced planning phase, with initial earth site work expected to start in Spring 2013.\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi (“OT”) project is a large-scale copper and gold mine consisting of an open-pit as well as an underground mine located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The OT mining operations will be powered for the first four years by imported electricity from China.  After four years, the project Investor Agreement with the Mongolian government requires the project to source its power needs domestically. Accordingly, a brand new on-site coal-fired power plant (“Power Plant”) will be constructed which will power the mine for the long-term. The Power Plant will consist of five boilers of 150 MW capacity each, for a total of 750 MW, and will be fueled by coal from the nearby Tavan Tolgoi coal mine.   http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Tolgoi_assessment_Final.pdf?docID=11801\n\nThe total project cost $7.1 billion. The coal plant cost $500 million, representing 7% of project costs.  Coal accounts for 7% of the IFC's $400 million or $28 million.  http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-13/mongolia-seeks-investors-for-thermal-plant-to-power-oyu-tolgoi\n\nIFC’s  investment is a $400 million senior A Loan together with a B Loan of up to $600 million loan to be syndicated to international commercial banks, as part of a proposed $4billion project debt financing.

Central Java Power (CJP), a company incorporated in Indonesia in which Sumitomo \nCorporation has ownership interests, to provide project financing*2  to fund Tanjung Jati B Coal-Fired Power Plant \nExpansion Project.  The overall loan amount totaling up to ¥160 billion was provided through co-financing with the \nthree lead arrangers, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the Tokyo \nBranch of BNP Paribas Bank, with JBIC providing a political risk guarantee for the co-financed portion. \n \n2. In this project, CJP will construct an additional 1,320MW power generating plant (660MW×2 units) so as to expand \nthe capacity of the currently operating Tanjung Jati B Coal-Fired Power Plant, which was also funded by JBIC and \nthe co-financing lenders*3 , in Jepara, Central Java. CJP will lease the plant to P.T. Perusahaan Listrik Negara \n(PLN), a state-owned electricity company, for 20 years. \n \n3. According to the long-term power sector plan of Indonesia, the country’s power demand is projected to grow at an \nannual average rate of approximately 7.0% through 2016. Serious shortfalls in power supply conditions relative to \ndemand are thus foreseen, unless electricity generating capacity also increases. Since this project is an expansion \nproject of an existing power plant, its ancillary infrastructure is already in place. Therefore, the power plant will be \ncompleted in a relatively short period and will contribute to increasing Indonesia’s power supply capacity, which will \nalso lead to a better investment climate for Japanese companies operating in Indonesia. \n \n4. This is the first project signed within the framework of the Umbrella Note of Mutual Understanding (UNMU) on \nIndependent Power Producer (IPP) Projects signed by JBIC and the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia in September \n2006.*4?JBIC intends to contribute towards further strengthening the economic relationship between Japan and \nIndonesia under such policy frameworks as UNMU, while supporting Japanese industries in maintaining and \nimproving their international competitiveness by facilitating effective project structuring and utilizing a variety of \nfinancing techniques to implement JBIC’s risk-taking functions.",

It will also contribute to the efficient power supply by constructing power plant in the demand area, reducing long-distance power transmission. The project will further contribute to reduce high dependency on a particular source of power, namely, hydroelectric power, currently accounts for 37 percent of the total power production in the country.\nThe ODA loan will be used for procurement of goods and civil works related to the construction of power plant and transmission lines, procurement of consulting services and civil works related to the construction of facilities which will commonly be used by another power plant to be constructed nearby. \nPossible cooperation may be sought with existing technical assistance on the capacity building related to O&M of the power plant and technical and safety standards of the power station.\n\nExecuting agency: Vietnam Electricity (EVN) \nAddress: 18 Tran Nguyen Han Street, Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam \nPhone: +84 (4) 2220-0977, fax: +84 (4) 2220-1386 \nPlanned implementation schedule\n\n(1) Completion of project: May 2015, with operation of the installed thermal power plant \n(2) Issuing of letters of invitation for consulting services: January 2010 \n(3) Tender announcement for initial procurement package for international competitive bidding on project work: \nProcurement package title: Engineering Procurement Construction Package\nPublic announcement: April 2011",

The additional credit will help to scale-up ongoing activities related to expansion of access and productive use of electricity, contributing to the project's development impact for households and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The Additional Financing (AF) will support connecting an additional 48,000 households to the electricity grid as part of the second phase of the Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP). In addition, the AF will support scaling up of 'green connections' associated with energy efficient solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-voltaic systems; low-cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low-income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of electricity to promote increased use of electricity by SMEs. The additional activities have been estimated to be implemented in a timeframe of about 3 1/2 years. Therefore an extension of the closing date of the original credit to June 30, 2016, is required and is within three years of the closing date of the original credit.  \n\nThis project is 15% of $60 million for clean T & D and 75% for T & D general.",

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is subsidy. The Global Partnership Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) subsidy is a three year program consisting of a payment of US$35 per connected households (hh) to EEPCo in order to help the utility defray its working capital costs of providing a five-year loan to the customer. The second component of the project is output monitoring and verification (M&V)/auditing. This component will finance the monitoring and verification of outputs and auditing over the three-year period. In addition, the project will be subject to an external audit. An independent credible organization, yet to be identified, will be contracted. The third component of the project is the World Bank (WB) supervision to be performed over the three years of the GPOBA project. The project supervision covers the work of the task team leader, the technical specialists, and the fiduciary and safeguards staff for the supervision of GPOBA subsidies. Supervision will take place in conjunction with the other three energy access projects currently financed by the WB, which will enable a reduction in costs and better synergy among the multiple electrification efforts.",

The second component is the efficient utilization of biomass resources. The aim of this component is to increase the efficiency in the charcoal value chain by promoting more efficient stoves and charcoal production methods. The third component is the sustainable development of micro hydro resources. The scope of the component is to provide transparent market regulation and guidelines to facilitate small distributed power production and distribution services while building local private sector capacity that can plan, design, implement, and operate the plants. The fourth component is the solar energy. The project will also provide initial support to develop the market for solar water heaters (SWH) in Rwanda.

Enhanced capacity for application of environmental and social safeguards standards 5. Enhanced efficiency of IDCOL in developing and financing infrastructure subprojects\n\n(iii) promote renewable energy systems (RESs) by financing the set-up of RES such as solar home system (SHS) and other renewable energy applications such as biomass and gas installations (component C). One of the main aspects of Component C is to help provide access to environment-friendly electricity for rural population in off-grid areas by financing the set-up of RESs such as SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program, and biomass and gas installations under the lead of IDCOL. The proposed change concerns providing additional grant funding for component C of the Project for financing RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate Change Fund in parallel with the processing of the Project. However, the application process for both funds was only partially finalized by the time the Project was approved by ADB's Board on 2 October 2008. As a consequence, the grant financing will be processed as supplementary financing to be allocated to the Project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the Project will be funded from the following sources, namely: (i) Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB; and (ii) Grant of $1,300,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund. The proposed supplementary grant will complement the ADF funding of $33 million equivalent under component C of the Project. The $2 million allocation under the CEFPF will be used to provide a $25 buy-down grant per individual SHS. This will enable 80,000 low- and middle-income households and micro and small enterprises in IDCOL's solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. While loan financing under component C of the Project is exhausted to a large extent, the proposed supplementary financing will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors. Furthermore, the $1.3 million grant under CCF will provide IDCOL with a total available subsidy amount of $580,000 for the financing of up to 50% of total cost of other renewable energy applications such as biomass and biogas installations in rural areas with no access to grid electricity. The remaining grant amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for expenses related to the administration and monitoring of the renewable energy program such as: (i) $357,000 as program support administration cost of IDCOL for the management and monitoring on the use of the refinancing loans and grant component); (ii) $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of PO staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. Thanks to the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets maintenance, services and spare parts are available in reasonable vicinity of the SHSs customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is around 10 kilometers; (iii) $30,000 earmarked to carry out technical inspections; (iv) $60,000 for annual technical audits carried out by an audit firm for 2 consecutive years; and (v) $40,000 for appointing independent engineers to conduct feasibility studies, appraise and monitor renewable energy projects.",

The aim of the project is to promote energy efficiency and emission reduction measures in the province s industry sector, develop energy service companies (ESCOs), and enhance institutional capacity to identify and manage energy efficiency and emission reduction projects.\n\nThe selected two private enterprises Golden Yimeng Group (Golden Yimeng) and Dongying Lufang Metallic Materials (Lufang) are both industrial leaders in their respective areas and are proposing state-of-the-art energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The Golden Yimeng sub-project includes expanding the biogas capturing system to generate power and supply heat; using biowaste as fuel and to produce organic fertilizers; waste heat recovery and energy conservation from various process units; and using heat from solar parabolic concentrators to supply a 6-megawatt steam turbine to generate electricity. This will be the first such large-scale industrial solar application in the PRC. Lufang is among the top six copper producers in the PRC. Lufang sub-project will support and supplement the development of a zero coal copper ore smelting furnace an innovative technology. This technology will set the new market entry standard for future copper smelters and have a profound impact on energy efficiency and emission reduction efforts. The China Everbright Bank (CEB), Jinan branch, was selected as the FI through a competitive bidding process conducted in May 2010. The involvement of CEB, a commercial bank, in rolling over the fund will bring in sound banking expertise and governance in energy efficiency lending. It will also strengthen cooperation between the government agency (the PMO) and the domestic financial institution, which may encourage them to work together beyond the project and expand investments in this high priority area for the government.",

Crucially, in the crisis recovery environment, the Facility will provide medium-term funding to Bulgarian financial institutions for on-lending to SMEs to finance energy efficiency investments. By providing dedicated funding to SMEs to invest in energy efficient technologies, the Facility will enable the companies to remain or become more competitive in the enlarged EU market. The SMEs that will invest in energy efficiency will be better prepared for the impact of further rises in the energy prices which is especially difficult in the crisis environment.\n\nThe Facility will form part of the “Energy Efficiency and Green Economy Programme” (“the Programme”) to be launched by the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism (“the Ministry”). The Programme is part of the Operational Programme “Development of the Competitiveness of the Bulgarian Economy” 2007-2013 under which approximately €200 million from the European Regional Development Fund (“the Structural Funds”) and national co-financing have been earmarked for providing support to increase the efficiency and productivity of the SME sector through the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments by Bulgarian enterprises.\"",

The first is renewable energy. The project will finance renewable resources, such as geothermal, for heating and cooling purposes. \n\nAt the request of the Financial Intermediary (FI), the eligibility criteria for hydro-power projects have been altered to reflect the definition of renewable hydro-power projects in the renewable energy law, which defines small hydro as projects with a reservoir area limited to less than 15 km. \n\nThe Clean Technology Fund (CTF) will finance small hydro, those less than or equal to 10 MW in capacity, in addition to other emerging renewable technologies. \n\nThe second component is investment in energy efficiency. Some of the sub-sectors likely to be borrowers include iron and steel, cement, ceramics, chemicals, and textiles. \n\nFinally, the third component is the use of CTF resources. The benefits of the CTF financing will be lower interest rates and significantly longer tenor, which are expected to be large enough to significantly increase the incentive to undertake these projects.\n\n\nUnlike the first project, the participating Banks will borrow directly from the World Bank with a Government guarantee.  Also unlike the first project, the second will have an energy efficiency component, part of which will include technical assistance to stimulate public interest in energy efficiency and to build the capacity of both lenders and borrowers to develop, appraise and implement energy efficiency investments.\n\nTotal project cost: $650 million; $500 million IBRD and $150 million government",

The project would provide risk sharing for the creation of an additional new portfolio of approximately RMB 2.6 billion ($347 million equivalent) dedicated to industrial corporates for energy efficiency upgrades. \n\n- Advisory Services: \n\nA scaling up of the existing advisory services program to complement the new investment program. The Advisory Services Program will be implemented in partnership with the dedicated CHUEE team of PEP-China based out of IFC’s Beijing office. \n\nCHUEE II is a follow-on IFC investment following the successful implementation of CHUEE I (project 24631) with Industrial Bank (IB) and Bank of Beijing (BoB). The CHUEE I risk sharing facility is proven to be an effective way to mobilize, stimulate and leverage financing from commercial bank partners to energy efficiency (EE) improvement projects. Since the start of the CHUEE I with IB, the RSF has been utilized faster than expected due to the strong demand in the market for EE project financings.

There are four components to the project: i) the institutional reforms of the charcoal value chain will address the political economy and equity issues (income and decision making) particularly in the (supplying) regions, and in the country as a whole. It will support central and decentralized government, local government, as well as communities for a full implementation of the reform; ii) the sustainable wood fuels supply management will finance technical assistance, logistical support and equipment to central and decentralized forestry services, local collectivities, including Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) involved in forest/natural resource management/biodiversity and environmental-social protection activities; and communities to carry out; iii) the promotion and diversification of modern household energy will finance technical assistance, logistical means and equipment for the Directorate of Petroleum Products and Household Energy (DPHE) and private entrepreneurs to support massive production and dissemination of improved stoves and alternative wood fuel; and iv) the institutional arrangements for project implementation will support government institutions and community organizations to play their rightful role in scaling up the program; hence the consultants will play a more catalytic, supportive, and advisory role.",

After being processed in food, the açai pits are normally being dumped illegally or at a local landfill. By processing açai residues into biomass for energy generation in Europe, organic waste methanisation is avoided. In this way, the beneficiaries will earn additional income from carbon credit sales under the Clean Development Mechanism.

The project will displace the use of light fuel oil in diesel engine driven generators operated by the Guyana Power and Light Company (GPL), the national utility, in the Berbice region. As the utility currently has insufficient capacity, there is extensive use of self-generation by industry and households. The project will also displace a significant amount of this unregulated and inefficient self-generation as confidence in reliable supply is progressively built over time. The cogeneration plant will use bagasse from the sugar factory during the cane crop seasons, and will be equipped with diesel generating capacity for co-firing fuel oil during off-crop periods when bagasse stocks have been exhausted. Under this project scheme, surplus electricity will be generated at an average of 10 MW of electricity delivering approximately 77 GWh per year to the regional grid on a firm power, year-round basis. Of the 77 GWh to be exported to the grid annually, about 85 percent (65.45 GWh) will be generated directly from bagasse, with the balance from fuel oil during off-crop periods. In addition to the grid export, 58.8 GWh per year will be produced for internal use at the sugar mill.",

Maple Etanol S.R.L. and an affiliate, special purpose vehicles acting as co-borrowers, and their sponsor Maple Energy Plc and The Maple Companies Limited will develop a 35 million gallons/year ethanol distillery in the state of Piura on the northwest coast of Peru. The Companies expect to plant 7,800 hectares of sugarcane on approximately 14,000 hectares of land and produce their own electricity through a 37 Megawatt biomass-based cogeneration facility that will also sell excess electricity to the national grid. Booker Tate Limited, an international operator of sugar plantations, has been contracted by Maple to develop and manage the sugarcane lands, all of which will be harvested mechanically. The Project will source its water needs from the nearby Chira River and use a water-conserving drip irrigation system to be developed and implemented by a supplier. The Companies will operate and manage the Project. The ethanol produced is expected to be sold to the European Union and the United States markets. It will be exported through storage and shipment facilities that will be built near the port of Paita. The Companies will also be positioned to supply ethanol to the Peruvian market when a 7.8% ethanol blend in gasoline becomes mandatory nationwide. The Companies will sign a long-term marketing agreement for all their exported ethanol. The Project will be one of the first large-scale ethanol production facilities in Peru that will aim to integrate local communities in the provision of services and employment. The Project aims to make annual cash transfers to the Regional Government of Piura pursuant to a Land Purchase Agreement that will finance the execution of social development projects. The surplus electricity generated and sold to the national grid aims to help reduce Peru’s dependence on fossil fuel-fired power plants. Companies and the government expect that the Project’s adoption of water-conserving drip irrigation technology will encourage the sustainable use of water resources in other agricultural activities in the region.
