The project would encompass new public, private and community based delivery models for both grid and off-grid technologies and would consist of the following three components: on-grid rural electrification, the National Rural Electrification Strategy study has identified 27 service territories in twelve governorates for rural electric service expansion and integration into the national grid. The second component is the off-grid electrification, this component would provide electricity service to off grid areas based on SHS. The areas of focus will be the fringe areas of the twelve selected service territories that are on-grid extensions and areas outside the service territories in the seven governorates which have been defined as off-grid areas. The grid and the off-grid programs will broadly follow common principles with respect to technical quality, service standards and organizational principles. The third component is the institutional support and technical assistance, key items to be addressed through this component include: (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of the agencies responsible for carrying out the on-grid and the off-grid rural electrification delivery services; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity; (iii) supporting the establishment and initial operation of the eligible Rural Electricity Service Providers (RESP) within the project area; (iv) designing and implementing a tariff framework that will ensure the financial sustainability of the eligible RESPs; (v) provision of support to the Project Management Unit; (vi) preparation of studies on rural energy with particular emphasis on renewable energy; and (vii) developing a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply strategy to improve access to LPG among the rural population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDA $25 mill; African Development Bank 47.1 mill;  Islamic Development Bank - Al Aqsa Fund  25.4 mill; German Development Service 3.5 mill",

MIGAâ€™s guarantee is being requested for â‚¬35 million of non-shareholder loans plus â‚¬17 million of interest and â‚¬23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus â‚¬22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEIB Project: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to CabeÃ³lica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, SÃ£o Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island. Each wind farm will include towers with wind turbines, transformers, a substation, a command centre, an underground transmission line and an access road.",

Current production is between 450MW-550MW. However with ash build up and pileup operation efficiencies will go down and the plant can be shut down if the rehabilitation of the ash plant is not undertaken. The rehabilitation of the Ash Plant will therefore mitigate the ash build up hence ensure availability of the operating plants. Service will also be restored to part of the 22000 customers that have been discontinued due to lack of maintenance and vandalism.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe project will also address humanitarian concern to avoid major disruptions in power supply that may lead to grave impacts on the population of the country, particularly as most of the water supply in Harare depends heavily on power consuming treatment plants necessary to prevent future cholera outbreak. The project creates synergy with another Bank intervention \"Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project the objective of which is to provide emergency assistance to the Municipalities of Harare, Chitungwiza, Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu, to improve water production and wastewater treatment capacity and reduce potential of outbreak of water borne diseases",

The programme aims to contribute to improving the living conditions of rural communities through sustainable access to electricity and to boost the accelerated municipalisation programme initiated by the Government in 2004 aimed at providing all District headquarters with basic social infrastructure. The programme will be implemented in several stages, taking into account the on-going development of power transmission grids. The electrification of the first 20 centres in the 10 Departments is funded by Indian Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project submitted to the Bank for financing is a continuation of the implementaiton of the Programme in five departments (Pointe-Noire, Bouenza, Plateaux, Cuvette, and Cuvette-Ouest). The total cost, net of taxes, is estimated at UA 15.67 million. The main expected outputs at the end of 48 months of project implementation are: (i) construction of 305 km of medium and low voltage distribution grids; (ii) building of 71 MV/LV transformer stations; (iii) electrification of 59 new localities, including two rural communities and two District headquarters; (iv) installation of 5,100 connections; (v) installation of 2,255 street lighting units; and (vi) capacity building for public entities of the electricity sub-sector. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated population of the project area is 120,000, nearly 10% of the countryâ€™s rural population. The project will make it possible to provide grid connection and electrical energy from hydroelectric and gas-fired plants to: (i) 5,100 households or 25,500 inhabitants; (ii) 17 health centres; (iii) 40 educational establishments; (iv) 24 boreholes; (iv) 38 administrative centres and companies; and (v) a commercial area. The beneficiary communities will be sensitized on electrical hazards and electricity consumption control through information, education and communication campaigns.",

   "This flagship ADF PRG will support the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project in Kenya. Africaâ€™s biggest wind power project: 300 MW wind farm comprising 365 wind turbines of 850kW capacity each and a 33kV electrical network. The average electricity production of the project is estimated at 1,440 GWh per year, equivalent to the annual generation capacity of Namibia in 2010, and will be sold to the grid at a price of .0752 â‚¬/Kwh. Under the wind project, the Lake Turkana Transmission Line Delay PRG will be used to alleviate the risk for the construction of a 428-kilometre publicly owned transmission line between Loyangalani and Suswa and associated substations needed to connect the project to the national grid.The objective of the project is to meet the rapidly increasing demand by diversifying the country's energy resources and developing its renewable energy potentials. The project will also increase access to energy through connections to substations; planned geothermal plants will also be evacuated through the transmission line and in the medium to long-term lead to a decrease in end-user tariffs.",

Nine subprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. The Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model as a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in other high energy consuming provinces. An EPP can be developed at about half the cost of a coal-fired power plant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an efficiency power plant (EPP) to be developed with annual 532 GWh energy savings and an equivalent 107 MW capacity, (ii) development of the energy service sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for promoting and assessing energy efficiency projects, and (iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces, implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of coal, resulting in emission reductions of 415,460 t/y of CO2, 1,785 t/y of total suspended particulates, 4,795 t/y of SO2, and 1,068 t/y of NOx.",

   "Project #37399- 01; Outcome: Dagachhu Hydropower Development. The impact of the Project is to sustain the country's inclusive economic growth by promoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. Accelerating the development of hydropower for export is of strategic significance for Bhutans economy. Given the Governments limited fiscal capacity for large infrastructure projects, the hydropower development strategy is to leverage public and private investments through private participation in development projects. This approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, and generate income for more socioeconomic development. To promote the countrys strategy, the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) supported the Government in establishing a policy and institutional framework for public and private participation in hydropower development. The Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP facility in line with the Hydropower Development Policy, which is to promote private and foreign investments for hydropower generation in Bhutan. Further TA support will be provided to develop Government capacity for hydropower export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 37399-043.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Power Development Project was approved on 29 October 2008. It includes two components: (i) hydropower development and (ii) rural electrification. Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126 megawatt (MW) run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The second component provides access to electricity in rural areas for around 9,000 rural households and public facilities on an on-grid and off-grid basis using renewable energy sources (i.e., hydropower and solar power).Â The proposed additional financing will ensure successful completion of Dagachhu hydropower development where the construction cost has overrun mainly due to unexpected geological conditions in the underground excavation works and their relevant price escalation. The project site is in the southwestern area of Bhutan around 50 km away from the cross-border of India.\n\n\n\n\"",

   "Project ID: 39653- 04, The Investment Program is to finance an efficiency power plant (EPP) in Guangdong province, equivalent to 107 megawatts, using the financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality. Nine subprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. The Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model as a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in other high energy consuming provinces. An EPP can be developed at about half the cost of a coal-fired power plant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an efficiency power plant (EPP) to be developed with annual 532 GWh energy savings and an equivalent 107 MW capacity, (ii) development of the energy service sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for promoting and assessing energy efficiency projects, and (iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces, implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of coal, resulting in emission reductions of 415,460 t/y of CO2, 1,785 t/y of total suspended particulates, 4,795 t/y of SO2, and 1,068 t/y of NOx.",

   "ADB Project 44013-013 (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed project will improve energy efficiency and reduce emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants in Shanxi province by introducing and expanding district heating in five urban areas and expanding the coal-mine methane (CMM) gas supply and distribution network in one of these areas. The project follows and complements two previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in the province, which have been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.adb.org/projects/44013-013/main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADB Project 44013- 01 (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge energy efficiency gains can be attained from the district heating subsector through (i) eliminating inefficient inner city small boilers and replacement with cleaner centralized district heating network; (ii) improving insulation in pipelines; and (iii) installation of demand control district heating systems; and (iv) implementing tariff and energy conservation reforms in buildings. Households connected to the modern district heating network will enjoy a cleaner and greener living environment in addition to a comfortable heating service. Similarly, capture and utilization of CMM will avoid GHG emissions and improve the safety of miners, while the expansion of CMM gas distribution network will reduce direct coal burning, improve energy efficiency, and create a lucrative market for CMM. This will result in reduced energy consumption, air pollution and related health impacts, and provide the poor with clean, convenient and affordable energy.",

   "Project #44406- 01; To increase the capital required for the planned network expansion, it will be crucial to diversify its debt financing sources and strengthen its financial leverage effects. To finance its substantial investment plans over the next 7 years, Powergrid needs to raise resources of about $22 billion. Assuming a debt component of 65%, this translates to about $14 billion or $2 billion per annum. With the gradual reduction in availability of sovereign-backed funds, Powergrid will be compelled to expand its borrowing from commercial sources. It may no longer be able to rely exclusively on the rupee bond issue route to finance its long-term capital requirements. It needs to urgently diversify its sources of financing to include other options like global bond issues, borrowings in foreign currency from international institutions, and also resort to off-balance sheet financing like project finance, joint ventures, securitized facilities etc.",

   "Project number: 41340- 01, Preparation for the Advanced Electricity Metering Project. Locations: Samarkand, Bukhara, Jizzahk, Tashkent City, Tashkent Region, Sirdaria.  Activities: community meetings, discussions, and interviews, consumer education campaign to involve women's groups, and women leaders in business and government \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABD Project 41340-014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Following the progress of Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing on Advanced Electricity Metering Project, this phase 2 project will replicate and expand the advanced electricity metering (AEM) system that uses modern, accurate, and theft-proof revenue meters for the power grid system and the end-user in five new regions (Andijan, Ferghana, Kashkadarya, Namangan, and Surkhandarya). The project will help improve energy efficiency in the power distribution sector, by reducing commercial losses and improving the efficiency of electricity revenue collection. The project will include installation of 2.6 million meters and meter data management (MDM) system that includes billing and energy data management, and capacity development for operational improvement in reducing commercial losses. 2. The economy has sustained high growth, averaging 8.5% since 2006. Growth in 2013 and beyond is expected to remain at 7.5-9%. The Government of Uzbekistan (the government) prioritizes modernizing industry and developing infrastructure and the private sector. Reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to achieving these goals. One of the key challenges is the high level of commercial losses in the power sector. The state joint stock company Uzbekenergo, a vertically integrated utility fully owned by the government, estimates losses of 7.2% in transmission and 12.6% in distribution in 2011 (national average). Distribution losses in the targeted five regions ranged between 10.4% and 27.6% in 2011. 3. The high level of commercial losses is caused by the lack of investment in modernizing the distribution assets together with outdated manual operation that results in inaccurate, unreliable and inefficient revenue collection. Electricity meters are generally old, inaccurate, and susceptible to tampering, but still in service beyond their designed economic life without proper recalibration. Without proper grid metering, Uzbekenergo faces difficulty in accounting for electricity use or identifying electricity tampered. Manual-based tariff collection operation and billing system are subject to inaccurate, inefficient, and ineffective accounting of revenue collection. Current incentive mechanism to reduce commercial losses is not sufficiently institutionalized. 4. To overcome these challenges, Uzbekenergo has requested international financial institutions (IFIs) with ADB as the lead development partner to help implement and finance a nationwide AEM program. AEM, or smart metering with digital meters, allows two-way communication between the utility and consumers. AEM enables the utility to remotely monitor and disconnect supply without sending reading personnel to the site. It provides consumers with power usage information more frequently. AEM can also help identify losses, reduce commercial losses, and improve tariff collection. 5. Uzbekenergo aims at gradually covering all 5.8 million customers across the country. It has initiated its first large-scale AEM project financed by ADB, covering 1 million customers. The implementation consultant has been recruited, bidding has been launched, and prebid meeting was successfully held with participations from more than 20 firms. The contract award is expected by the end of 2013. Based on the smooth implementation of the phase 1 project, Uzbekenergo has requested ADB to finance the second phase project covering five regions. 6. The project follows ADB s strategy for Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply. The project is included in Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan 2012 2014.",

   "40517-042:  1. Improved lending terms of IDCOL for infrastructure subprojects 2. Improved ability of IDCOL to mobilize long-term capital 3. Enhanced governance at IDCOL 4. Enhanced capacity for application of environmental and social safeguards standards 5. Enhanced efficiency of IDCOL in developing and financing infrastructure subprojects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) promote renewable energy systems (RESs) by financing the set-up of RES such as solar home system (SHS) and other renewable energy applications such as biomass and gas installations (component C). One of the main aspects of Component C is to help provide access to environment-friendly electricity for rural population in off-grid areas by financing the set-up of RESs such as SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program, and biomass and gas installations under the lead of IDCOL. The proposed change concerns providing additional grant funding for component C of the Project for financing RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate Change Fund in parallel with the processing of the Project. However, the application process for both funds was only partially finalized by the time the Project was approved by ADB's Board on 2 October 2008. As a consequence, the grant financing will be processed as supplementary financing to be allocated to the Project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the Project will be funded from the following sources, namely: (i) Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB; and (ii) Grant of $1,300,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund. The proposed supplementary grant will complement the ADF funding of $33 million equivalent under component C of the Project. The $2 million allocation under the CEFPF will be used to provide a $25 buy-down grant per individual SHS. This will enable 80,000 low- and middle-income households and micro and small enterprises in IDCOL's solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. While loan financing under component C of the Project is exhausted to a large extent, the proposed supplementary financing will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors. Furthermore, the $1.3 million grant under CCF will provide IDCOL with a total available subsidy amount of $580,000 for the financing of up to 50% of total cost of other renewable energy applications such as biomass and biogas installations in rural areas with no access to grid electricity. The remaining grant amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for expenses related to the administration and monitoring of the renewable energy program such as: (i) $357,000 as program support administration cost of IDCOL for the management and monitoring on the use of the refinancing loans and grant component); (ii) $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of PO staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. Thanks to the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets maintenance, services and spare parts are available in reasonable vicinity of the SHSs customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is around 10 kilometers; (iii) $30,000 earmarked to carry out technical inspections; (iv) $60,000 for annual technical audits carried out by an audit firm for 2 consecutive years; and (v) $40,000 for appointing independent engineers to conduct feasibility studies, appraise and monitor renewable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADB Project 42180-013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed Second Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II or the Project). PPIDF II will build on the efforts of Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF I) in helping address the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh by providing long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through IDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and increase in employment opportunities. The design of the Project serves to attract commercial financing for infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget. An additional objective of the Project is to help provide the rural population and small to medium enterprises in off-grid areas with access to environment-friendly electricity. The proposed financing modalities of the Project. PPIDF II comprises two components, namely: (i) component 1 which will use the proceeds from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) sovereign loan up to $100 million to provide IDCOL with long-term additional resources for the financing of medium to large-sized private sector-led infrastructure projects with a total project cost of minimum $10 million; and (ii) component 2 which will route the proceeds from the sovereign Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of up to $10 million through IDCOL for the further expansion of its successful SHS program which has so far provided financing of more than 2 million SHS through a microfinance-based, direct sales program in rural off-grid areas to provide households and small businesses with a renewable source of energy. Component 1 will provide funding directly to subborrowers in form of providing long-term loans to infrastructure project while component 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating organizations (POs) to the end-user which are typically households in off-grid areas.",

   "45108-001: On 26 June 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved Loan 2429-VIE: Song Bung 4 (SB 4) Hydropower Project for $196 million, which became effective on 16 January 2009. The Project consists of the construction of a 156-megawatt hydropower plant on the Song Bung in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin and a 110-meter (m)-high roller compacted concrete dam on the same river with a crest length of 367 m. The Project is located in Nam Giang District of Quang Nam Province in Central Viet Nam, which is predominantly inhabited by indigenous people belonging to the Co Tu ethnic minority. The SB 4 Hydropower Project will result in the relocation of more than 1,200 Co Tu ethnic minority people in Zuoih commune in Nam Giang District. The resettlement cost is funded by the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN). The Project is also supported by a complementary grant of $2 million financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) under Grant 9120: Livelihood Improvement of Vulnerable Ethnic Minority Communities Affected by the SB 4 Hydropower Project in Quang Nam Province. The JFPR project was approved by ADB on 26 June 2008 and became effective on 10 November 2008. The SB 4 Hydropower Project has several negative social impacts on the people who live in the reservoir, downstream, and upstream areas. The impacts include the (i) relocation of more than 1,200 people living in the reservoir area, which represents more than 97% of the people in the area, and 27,340 people from 89 villages along the Bung River downstream and upstream of the dam; and (ii) acquisition of land for more than 500 ethnic minority people for the development of resettlement sites and access roads to resettlement sites. In view of these, SB 4 Hydropower Project is considered a high-risk project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding source: Technical Assistance Special Fund",

To optimize transnational power supply and promote country-wide power transfer in an efficient manner, the Government aims to integrate regional power grid network systems, which comprise five interconnected electrical regions including northern, north-eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region attempts to connect and synchronize power system of neighboring states within the region, but interregional power transfer capacity has still been limited. Since natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in certain locations, surplus power from some regions can be transferred to other regions in power deficit only when creating transmission super highways among the regions. While the existing interregional transmission capacity stands at 22,400 MW, the Government targets to increase this capacity to 27,950 MW by 2012, growing to 57,000 MW by 2015, and 75,000 MW by 2017 under the 12th Five Year Plan. Such interregional transmission strengthening will create a backbone to sustain open power supply and investment in both generation and distribution.",

Subsequently, on 28 March 2008, ADB approved the MFF of an aggregate amount of $600 million to POWERGRID for the Investment Program. Initially, the scope of the program comprised of two projects; Project 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity for Evacuation of Power from Uttarakhand, and Project 2: ?800 kV High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Northeastern Northern/Western Interconnector. However, due to the delay in commissioning of the associated hydropower generating facilities in Uttarakhand, POWERGRID decided to keep on hold the implementation of Project 1 until 2013. As a result, it was decided that all ADB facility of $600 million under the MFF will be utilized to fund Project 2: +800kV HVDC North East - Northern/Western Interconnector in two tranches. Loan Agreements for Tranche 1 (Loan No. 2415-IND: $400 million) and Tranche 2 (Loan No. 2510-IND: $ 200 million) were signed on 28 March 2008 and 27 March 2009, respectively. Current completion dates for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are 30 June 2013, and 30 June 2014, respectively. All contracts under Tranche 1 ($388 million approx.) and Tranche 2 ($119 million approx.) have been awarded in 2010. Based on the contract award, the loan savings of $76 million was confirmed. ADB received the Periodic Financing Request (PFR) for Tranche 3 for an amount of $76 million under the MFF on 21 June 2011 (Appendix 1).

The subprojects are expected to have a loan repayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these subprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects through the REF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which provided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010. The Government of the PRC has recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated emissions. It has committed to achieve 40% 45% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared with 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions. During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006 2010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011 2015, has set a target of a further 16% energy intensity reduction. More than three fourths of the PRC s electricity and about half of its primary energy are consumed by the industrial sector. The 1,000 Key Enterprises Program was launched during the Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about two-thirds of the total industrial energy consumption. During the Twelfth plan, the ongoing program will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of 10,000 tons of coal equivalent (tce) and higher. It will involve some 16,000 enterprises in the country, primarily among nine energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel, nonferrous metal, coal, power generation, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, textile, and pulp and paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 44012-013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome of the project is increased investments in energy efficiency in Hebei Province.

This mixed rural distribution network faces several problems: the overuse of subsidized electricity for agricultural water pumping leaves households with an inadequate power supply, and the unauthorized use of electricity causes the DISCOMs to suffer financial losses. Aging and overloaded distribution lines and transformers result in excessive technical losses and poor quality power. To prevent the overuse of electricity by agricultural pumps and to reduce losses, the DISCOMs switch on the distribution lines serving the rural areas for a limited number of hours per day. The existing mixed-feeder system does not allow power to be supplied on a 24-hour basis to households and business establishments, constraining economic growth and development in rural areas. To promote efficient use of groundwater in agriculture and improve on-farm water conservation practices, the DISCOMs supply 3-phase electricity in rural areas for 8 10 hours daily. However, this constraints economic activities and the constant (24-hour) supply of quality power to households. Attempted supply of one phase power, after 8 10-hour supply of three phase power, to reduce overuse of power by irrigation pumps by the DISCOMs was not effective. Separation of power supply lines (feeders) to agriculture and other customers is necessary to ensure the 24-hour supply of power to households. Additional measures such as installation of a HVDS and metering, together with better system management practices are necessary to reduce DISCOMs technical and commercial losses.",

Physical Outputs of Tranche 3 (i) Rehabilitation of Gereshk Hydro Power Station. (i) installation of 3 units of new turbines with installed capacity of 4.5 MW, (ii) modernizing the power house with gantry crane and other equipment, (iii) replacements of bypass channel radial gates, water gates and stoplogs at Boghra canal intake, and (iv) repair of eroded and collapsed banks of the canal; (ii) Upgrading of distribution network. (i) Replacement of the existing 3.3/44 kV substation at the hydro power plant with a new 3.3/20 kV substation; (ii) Re-building or re-using the 44 kV overhead line to the Gereshk town substation; (iii) Replacement of 44/3.3 kV town substation with a new 20/3.3 kV step down point; (iv) Reinforcement the supplies into the existing 3.3 kV network by installing new 20 kV circuits and 20/3.3 kV transformers; (v) Complete replacement of the existing Gereshk 3.3 kV network with a new 20 kV distribution network. (iii) New and replacements of customer service connections. New and replacement of the low voltage customer service connections and installation of new metering for about 7,500 households in the Gereshk town center area.\n\n\n\nThe access to reliable power supply is severely limited in Gereshk. The estimated population of Gereshk District is 70,000, out of which 50,000 people, or 7,500 households, reside within the 6 km radius of the town center. Presently only about 2,500 households have connections to the local electricity distribution system, while 5,000 households claim to await new connections. Some have their own diesel generators which are too expensive for the mass and the poor. Even for those connected to the electricity network, chronic load shedding during both the morning and evening peak hours means that most receive only a few hours of power supply a day and the existing infrastructure does not allow continued access to power.",

The project follows and complements two previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in the province, which have been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.adb.org/projects/44013-013/main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADB Project 44013- 01 (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge energy efficiency gains can be attained from the district heating subsector through (i) eliminating inefficient inner city small boilers and replacement with cleaner centralized district heating network; (ii) improving insulation in pipelines; and (iii) installation of demand control district heating systems; and (iv) implementing tariff and energy conservation reforms in buildings. Households connected to the modern district heating network will enjoy a cleaner and greener living environment in addition to a comfortable heating service. Similarly, capture and utilization of CMM will avoid GHG emissions and improve the safety of miners, while the expansion of CMM gas distribution network will reduce direct coal burning, improve energy efficiency, and create a lucrative market for CMM. This will result in reduced energy consumption, air pollution and related health impacts, and provide the poor with clean, convenient and affordable energy.",

Tranche 1 mainly focuses on generation expansion. Tranche 2 focuses on transmission and distribution improvement together with a pilot solar irrigation component. Tranche 3 also invests on generation expansion. Generation expansion in the MFF will be undertaken through supply side energy efficiency improvement so that about 50% power can be generated without burning additional gas. Given the acute gas shortages in Bangladesh, conversion of single cycle gas fired power plants to combined cycle plants the technology adopted in the investment program is the best way to expand the generation capacity. The sequencing of the tranches is well aligned with the sector needs and the government program. The Tranche 1 of the proposed Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program will address two key areas in the power sector aligning with the priorities identified in the CPS: improving energy use efficiency of thermal power plants; and improving the transmission network capacity. The project interventions will include: (i) adding 235 MW capacity by conversion of four single cycle gas fired power plants to combine cycle plants at Khulna, Baghabari, Sylhet and Shahjibazar; (ii) construction of 180 km 132 kV transmission lines and four 133/32 kV substations; and (iii) capacity building. The capacity building component includes training on investment planning, operations planning, energy auditing and monitoring, financial management and auditing, project preparation and appraisal, and operation and maintenance of solar irrigation pumps. In addition, the capacity building component will provide consultants for preparation of subsequent tranches and implementation support.",

Those communities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather sparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADB Project 42039-035.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investment program will contribute to meeting electricity demand growth of industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The outcome of the investment program is enhanced capacity of the transmission network to balance power load. The investment program also supports partial implementation of National Power Sector Development Master Plan VII (PDMP VII) to meet growing electricity demand of industrial, commercial and residential consumers throughout Viet Nam, and improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) the entity responsible for financing, managing, and operating the transmission network to ensure reliable electricity supply. Tranche 2 will finance part of each of the three output components: Component 1: Expanded Transmission Network (Physical investment) Component 2: Improved Operational Effectiveness and Efficiency (Non-physical investment) Component 3: Project Implementation Support (Non-physical investment)",

   "ADB Project 46472-001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed TA is a timely response to the government's request for ADB's assistance for the implementation of the NECP in the PRC. The proposed TA is aligned with NEA's priorities for developing a comprehensive New Energy City Framework and establishing appropriate support mechanisms to deploy distributed renewable energy applications. The TA will provide a best practice model in planning, appraising, implementing distributed renewable energy development in second-tier cities of Gansu and other provinces. A successful demonstration in the two cities of Dunhuang and Wuwei how to address critical capacity barriers for the effective implementation of the NECP will facilitate its replication The lessons learned from this TA will be shared and discussed with NEA, other relevant cities and provinces, and other relevant stakeholders. The TA concept fits very well with the government's priority of fostering green and low-carbon development, and is fully consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy (2011-2015) for the PRC with emphasis on promoting resource efficiency, environmentally sustainable growth, and addressing climate change. The TA is expected to deliver the following outputs: (i) Priority projects of Dunhuang and Wuwei cities are appraised and prepared for implementation. (ii) Capacity strengthened in planning and implementing the NECP. (iii) Pilot projects implemented for demonstration in both cities. (iv) Best practices in the NECP implementation developed and disseminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NECP targets a representative set of second-tier cities with varying economic structures, load characteristics and renewable energy resource endowment. By 2015, each of the selected demonstration cities shall make full use of its locally available renewable energy sources and would have doubled its existing share of renewable energy in its overall energy mix to a minimum threshold level of 6% in 2010. Furthermore, by 2015, each city shall install (i) solar thermal plants covering an area of at least 1.0 square kilometer, (ii) solar photovoltaic panels of 20.0 megawatt, (iii) distributed wind power of at least 100 megawatt, and (iv) shallow-geothermal installations and heat pumps covering an area of 3.0 square kilometers and biomass utilization shall reach 0.1 million ton of coal equivalent per year. Gansu Province is located in the central-west region of the PRC. Measured by a per capita gross domestic product standard, Gansu Province is ranked 27 among the 31 provinces in the PRC. It relies on tourism and industries for its economic growth. Dunhuang city, as a world cultural heritage site, and Wuwei city, with its long-standing history, are at the heart of the tourism development strategy of the province. While tourism infrastructure has been built up over the past decades, the greening of the cities energy sector is important to improve the local air quality to ensure its attractiveness to tourists. Wuwei city s central location makes it an important business and transportation hub; many major railroads and national highways pass through Wuwei. Both Dunhuang and Wuwei cities are endowed with significant renewable energy resources, in particular rich solar resources characterized by (i) high solar irradiation with more than 3,000 sunshine hours per year, (ii) a cool continental climate with an annual average temperature of about 9 degrees Celsius, and (iii) broad and flat deserted areas adjacent to urban agglomerations of the cities. These characteristics make the cities ideal for both distributed as well as large-scale development of solar power generation. Dunhuang city has been at the forefront to demonstrate solar photovoltaic (PV) applications in urban areas. Dunhuang's new energy city masterplan to double its existing share of renewable in its energy mix to more than 27% by 2015 was approved by NEA and it was selected as the demonstration city under the NECP. Dunhuang s masterplan involves investment of CNY26.8 billion by 2015 mainly in the areas of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal installations, micro-grid establishment to connect distributed renewable energy sources within the city, and supporting infrastructure to facilitate the use of electric vehicles. Wuwei is a major transport hub and tourist city in Gansu Province. Unlike Dunhuang, its existing share of renewable in the energy mix is only 3.25% by 2011, which it aims to increase to 8.38% by 2015. Wuwei city s masterplan was submitted to NEA in August 2012 and it was evaluated in October 2012 for formal inclusion in the new energy city program in December 2012. The Wuwei masterplan aims for investments of CNY837 million by 2015 for more than 200,000 solar heating applications, more than 30 MW solar PV capacity addition, more than 30 MW biomass power and 72 MW small hydropower projects. Both Dunhuang and Wuwei municipal governments face multiple technological, institutional, administrative, and financial challenges in scaled-up investments in developing and integrating distributed renewable energy in the local energy supply mix. The NECP implementation will pose significant challenges for cities to (i) translate the concepts for identified priority projects into financially and technologically viable projects; (ii) institute effective planning and implementation mechanisms to swiftly adjust the city s action and investment plan in view of NECP commitments; (iii) establish appropriate fiscal and financial support mechanisms to facilitate public, private, and public-private investments; (iv) begin data collection, monitoring and verification to effectively supervise the implementation of the plan; (v) establish and ascertain a close cooperation both between different departments within the municipal government as well as between the administration, private sector, and civil society throughout the plan s implementation; and (vi) supplement the plan with smart policy actions and measures to enhance energy conservation and energy efficiency effectively reducing the new renewable energy capacity required to achieve the target share in final energy consumption. The capacity of relevant staff of the city governments needs to be strengthened to effectively overcome these challenges and to ensure the timely implementation of the NECP in each city. To field test the readiness of each city and applicability of the recommended implementation measures, a pilot project will also be implemented in both Dunhuang and Wuwei. The pilot projects will test at small-scale a key priority project of each of the cities. Pilot projects will help to demonstrate the best practices in (i) project selection, (ii) technical design, (iii) economic and financial viability appraisal, (iv) permitting and agreement of fiscal support by the government, (v) procurement and installation of distributed energy applications, and (vi) project licensing to both municipal governments as well as potential investors.",

   "ADB Project 46498-001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed small-scale regional capacity building technical assistance (SR-CDTA) aims at providing critical operational support to develop operations strategy, business plans and roadmaps for the energy sector of each South Asia developing member country (DMC), including project identification, assist in project processing to ensure readiness and quality at entry for projects under preparation as well as project management activities. The SR-CDTA will also cover identification and preparation of investment transactions to further advance regional cooperation and integration (RCI). The SR-CDTA is not included in Country Operations Business Plans of individual DMCs. This technical assistance proposal is prepared based on indication from DMCs, received during various consultation missions, regarding their needs in developing energy sector operations strategy, business plans and roadmaps, expanding RCI and improving project quality at entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Country Operations Business Plans for South Asia DMCs envisage Asian Development Bank (ADB) contribution to the energy sector development for (i) increased development of renewable energy and low-carbon energy sources (e.g., run-of-the-river hydropower projects, solar, and wind energy); (ii) capacity expansion of national transmission and distribution systems; (iii) improving energy efficiency and lowering of transmission and distribution losses; and (iv) institutional strengthening for implementation of energy sector reforms in line with relevant national acts and other regulatory initiative being undertaken by the governments in DMCs. Such ADB contribution will be provided through numerous investment and technical assistance projects, some of which may require further identification and discussion with the DMCs governments. Taking into consideration potential complexity of these investment and technical assistance transactions and importance of ensuring high project quality and timely project implementation, it would be important to ensure relevant operational support in further developing energy sector operational strategy and business plans, energy sector RCI initiatives, project planning and management for DMCs.",

The CDTA will also enhance NMG s capacity in structuring PPPs for clean energy investments through appropriate allocation of responsibilities and risks between private and public sector entities. The CDTA will identify technologies and industrial processes to achieve the benchmark energy efficiency levels and assist NMG in establishing a technology transfer mechanism through technology providers, such as energy service companies (ESCOs). Since the ESCOs have the right technical expertise on appropriate technologies but are constrained by access to debt financing, the CDTA will be developing innovative financial products and instruments and recommend the establishment of a dedicated financing platform to mobilize financing for energy efficiency projects implemented by ESCOs and SMEs overcoming prevailing barriers. If successful, it can be introduced and replicated in other parts of the PRC. Integration of distributed renewable energy sources poses a number of technical, institutional, and financial challenges for investments to flow in scattered but large number of small-scale renewable energy projects compared to a single large-scale project. The role of private investments in such projects cannot be emphasized enough.

   "ADB Project 47037-002.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) compared with 29% in 1990. But a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 54% in 2011 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not the solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix, especially from renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network also needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. Another challenge is to improve system reliability and cut technical losses. 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network is needed to expand power supply into rural areas, where many of the poor households remain unconnected or have poor quality of supplies. The new energy agenda also targets more clean energy. This is yet another means to ensure sector sustainability in the long term. Finally, the government intends to pursue financial, managerial, and institutional reforms, in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009. The government intends to pursue cost recovery and expects that with the introduction of low-cost coal-fired generation it will be possible to address the current high cost of power generation and achieve cost recovery from 2018. As part of its cost recovery strategy, the government increased retail electricity tariffs by 35% on average in April 2013. While the government aims to increase supply capacity and replace expensive and inefficient oil-fired power plants by constructing the coal-fired plants, the remaining supply capacity will need to come from renewable sources (and conversion of the oil-fired plants to gas-fired plants). The 20% increase in power generation from non-conventional renewable sources will be in addition to the current 45% of the conventional hydropower and will ensure that most of electricity will be generated by domestic clean energy sources in the future. This will address the critical question about the energy security agenda.",

Naryn cascade accounts for 97% of the hydro capacity and 78% of the total installed power generation capacity in the country. Toktogul HPP is the region's only multi-year storage capacity. Producing 50% of the average electricity output, the power plant plays a critical role as a domestic power source and as a power exporter and provider of frequency regulator services to the Central Asian power system (CAPS). CAPS comprises the synchronously interconnected systems of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. Tajikistan, previously connected to CAPS, is currently operating on an island mode. Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) Electric Power Plants (EPP), the state-owned generation company, wishes to implement the complete rehabilitation of the Toktogul HPP as recommended by the PPTA Study of Hydropower Plants on Naryn Cascade (PPTA Study for Phase 1). Toktogul HPP has been in service since 1975 with no significant rehabilitation or modernization work having been undertaken. Critical equipment is failing, resulting in availability dropping to 80%. It is considered that availability rates will continue to drop in the absence of rehabilitation. Phase 1 has been initiated covering critical secondary mechanical and electrical equipment that are becoming unreliable and unsafe to operate. The implementation consultant has been fielded. The contract award is expected by early 2014. In 2001, the state-owned utility was unbundled into one generation, one transmission, four electricity distribution companies, and one district heating company. This unbundled sector structure remains in effect today. Various privatization initiatives have been conducted with insignificant success following a negative social reaction. No new privatization initiatives of existing assets are planned in the medium term. Government policy is for new generation assets to be developed largely by the private sector while existing government-owned assets are rehabilitated by sovereign borrowing. The government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component of its development plan. The project is aligned with the government's and ADB's strategy to (i) focus on reliable power supply, (ii) improve sector financial and corporate management, (iii) increase energy security, and (iv) expand regional power exports. Both phase 2 and phase 3 projects will be included in ADB's country operation business plan 2014-2016. Phase 3 is programmed for 2016.",

The impact of the Project is to sustain the country's inclusive economic growth by promoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. Accelerating the development of hydropower for export is of strategic significance for Bhutans economy. Given the Governments limited fiscal capacity for large infrastructure projects, the hydropower development strategy is to leverage public and private investments through private participation in development projects. This approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, and generate income for more socioeconomic development. To promote the countrys strategy, the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) supported the Government in establishing a policy and institutional framework for public and private participation in hydropower development. The Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP facility in line with the Hydropower Development Policy, which is to promote private and foreign investments for hydropower generation in Bhutan. Further TA support will be provided to develop Government capacity for hydropower export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 37399-043.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Power Development Project was approved on 29 October 2008.

Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126 megawatt (MW) run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The second component provides access to electricity in rural areas for around 9,000 rural households and public facilities on an on-grid and off-grid basis using renewable energy sources (i.e., hydropower and solar power).Â The proposed additional financing will ensure successful completion of Dagachhu hydropower development where the construction cost has overrun mainly due to unexpected geological conditions in the underground excavation works and their relevant price escalation.

One of the main aspects of Component C is to help provide access to environment-friendly electricity for rural population in off-grid areas by financing the set-up of RESs such as SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program, and biomass and gas installations under the lead of IDCOL. The proposed change concerns providing additional grant funding for component C of the Project for financing RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate Change Fund in parallel with the processing of the Project. However, the application process for both funds was only partially finalized by the time the Project was approved by ADB's Board on 2 October 2008. As a consequence, the grant financing will be processed as supplementary financing to be allocated to the Project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the Project will be funded from the following sources, namely: (i) Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB; and (ii) Grant of $1,300,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund. The proposed supplementary grant will complement the ADF funding of $33 million equivalent under component C of the Project. The $2 million allocation under the CEFPF will be used to provide a $25 buy-down grant per individual SHS. This will enable 80,000 low- and middle-income households and micro and small enterprises in IDCOL's solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. While loan financing under component C of the Project is exhausted to a large extent, the proposed supplementary financing will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors. Furthermore, the $1.3 million grant under CCF will provide IDCOL with a total available subsidy amount of $580,000 for the financing of up to 50% of total cost of other renewable energy applications such as biomass and biogas installations in rural areas with no access to grid electricity. The remaining grant amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for expenses related to the administration and monitoring of the renewable energy program such as: (i) $357,000 as program support administration cost of IDCOL for the management and monitoring on the use of the refinancing loans and grant component); (ii) $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of PO staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. Thanks to the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets maintenance, services and spare parts are available in reasonable vicinity of the SHSs customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is around 10 kilometers; (iii) $30,000 earmarked to carry out technical inspections; (iv) $60,000 for annual technical audits carried out by an audit firm for 2 consecutive years; and (v) $40,000 for appointing independent engineers to conduct feasibility studies, appraise and monitor renewable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADB Project 42180-013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed Second Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II or the Project). PPIDF II will build on the efforts of Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF I) in helping address the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh by providing long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through IDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and increase in employment opportunities. The design of the Project serves to attract commercial financing for infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget. An additional objective of the Project is to help provide the rural population and small to medium enterprises in off-grid areas with access to environment-friendly electricity. The proposed financing modalities of the Project. PPIDF II comprises two components, namely: (i) component 1 which will use the proceeds from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) sovereign loan up to $100 million to provide IDCOL with long-term additional resources for the financing of medium to large-sized private sector-led infrastructure projects with a total project cost of minimum $10 million; and (ii) component 2 which will route the proceeds from the sovereign Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of up to $10 million through IDCOL for the further expansion of its successful SHS program which has so far provided financing of more than 2 million SHS through a microfinance-based, direct sales program in rural off-grid areas to provide households and small businesses with a renewable source of energy. Component 1 will provide funding directly to subborrowers in form of providing long-term loans to infrastructure project while component 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating organizations (POs) to the end-user which are typically households in off-grid areas.",

   "ADB Project 44426-017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to facilitate transfer of renewable energy from the renewable energy rich states to other states, as well as absorption and smoothing out of the intermittency from such power sources, Powergrid has identified requisite transmission investments. These include strengthening of grid connectivity to enlarge the power balancing area, reactive compensation, establishment of Renewable Energy Management Centers equipped with advanced forecasting tools along with reliable communications, and technology in the form of phasor measurement units and wide area measuring systems throughout the transmission system linked to the control centers through fiber optic communications for real time information, monitoring and control. Investment requirements, excluding various intra-state requirements, total about $4.2 billion. The investments to be funded with the proposed ADB loan have a total project cost of about $1 billion, for which it is proposed that ADB provide a $500 million loan. The ADB loan envisages green energy corridor components, including two 765 kV direct current lines , a 3000 MVA 765/400 kV substation at Suratgarh, and associated reactive compensation , plus upgradation of an existing high voltage direct current corridor , and increased interconnectivity between the western and southern regions. An additional component includes investments in static compensators to improve grid stability in response to previous grid disturbance in northern India. The proposed ADB loan will thus improve interstate power flows and system reliability, so that the overall system is more accommodating to the growing intermittent renewable energy sources under development and the possibility of the future development of renewable energy sources by both public and private sector will be enhanced in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian power sector has a history of steadily increasing demand for, and chronic shortages of, electricity. An adequate power supply contributes to poverty alleviation, yet over 30% of India s population lack access to electricity. Continued shortages significantly constrain commercial and industrial activity and reduce growth. Businesses and manufacturers must utilize more expensive back-up power supplies, often diesel fuel-based, which increase their costs, undercut competitiveness and contributes to unwanted GHG emissions. Insufficient domestic fuel resources and rising international coal and oil prices threaten India s already fragile energy security, such that maximizing renewable energy sources is a government priority. Presently the total installed electricity generation capacity in India is about 228.7 giga-watt (GW) as of 30 September 2013. Out of this, about 13% (29 GW) is from renewable energy sources. During India s 12th Five Year Plan (2013-2017), the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) targets an additional 32 GW of renewable energy generation capacity from wind, solar, small hydropower and biomass sources, more than doubling the existing capacity. However, the intermittent nature of these renewable energy sources threatens transmission grid stability, such that considerable new transmission system investment is required to effectively evacuate renewable power from its source locations to the grid, and to perform system balancing functions. MNRE and the Forum of Regulators commissioned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (Powergrid) to conduct a study to identify requisite nationwide transmission investments required to accommodate the anticipated additional renewable energy generation capacity. Powergrid is the public sector corporation that is mainly responsible for construction, expansion, operations and maintenance of India s inter-state and inter-regional power transmission network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(for ensuing project) Enhanced transmission system capacity to absorb large renewable energy capacity additions.",

The new facility will build on the success of the original framework, continuing the good work that has been achieved with PBs and will especially target areas that remain underdeveloped, i.e. more complex refurbishment of larger dwellings as well as housing associations that have just received legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition impact of the Project extension stems from the followings sources:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion and enhanced competition in the market for energy efficiency products and services - the stringent eligibility criteria under this facility will only allow installation of best available technology equipment thus creating a demand pull for more efficient equipment as well as quality suppliers/installers to compete for providing quality equipment and services, alongside other energy efficiency products, to the market.\n\n\n\nDemonstration of energy efficiency products in the market - the expanded Project will include higher standard equipments and expand towards more comprehensive building level refurbishments. Market penetration rates of specific eligible  techniques are close to zero and REECL financing will help to expand the market of technologies and associated services;\n\n\n\nDemonstration of intermediation with associations of apartment owners - refurbishments by associations can have a more comprehensive and larger scale impact on energy efficiency and emissions savings. However, Bulgarian banks are not yet confident and do not have experience with structuring lending to these newly established housing associations, that evidently lack credit history. The introduction of a loss risk cover mechanism and other incentives under the facility will help promote lending to associations of apartment owners and this targeted lending will help demonstrate the associationâ€™s viability as market participants. This will have a strong demonstration effect and may encourage other transactions in the area of energy efficiency with housing associations, or even in other sectors.",

The project will increase the promoterâ€™s power generation from wind sources and shall consolidate its position within the Spanish market. It will comprise the installation of a combined capacity of around 240 MW over the 2007-2009 period.  The project will generate renewable energy for supply to the public grid, and will thereby partly replace fossil fuel-fired power generation. This is in line with national and EU policy objectives and contributes to avoiding the release of CO2 and other environmentally damaging emissions to the atmosphere. The project will also increase the promoterâ€™s share of power generation from wind sources and shall consolidate its position within the Spanish market.",

   "EBRD Project Number 39974: This is financing for construction of a new 860 MW combined cycle gas turbine power plant in Brazi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Plant (CCGT) will be constructed on a brown field site at the refinery and will consist of two 291 MWe co-generation units (gas turbines and recovery boilers) and one steam 313 MWe turbine. A dedicated 30km gas pipeline will be constructed to deliver gas to the power plant and a dedicated high voltage power line will be constructed to deliver power to the grid. Up to 20 percent of the power produced and up to 96 tons/hour steam will go to Petrom for internal use, with the remainder of the power going to the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetrom is the largest company in Romania and has proven oil and gas reserves of 872 mn boe, a maximum refining capacity of 8 million tons per year, approximately 550 petrol stations in Romania and 269 petrol stations in the Republic of Moldova, Bulgaria and Serbia (as of end 2008). It is 51 percent owned by OMV A.G., an Austria-based integrated oil company with interests throughout central and eastern Europe. Petrom is also traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal project cost is EUR 400 million, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development loan being EUR 200 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEIB: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project includes design, manufacturing, construction and operation of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) Power Plant in the vicinity of Ploiesti, Romania.

   "Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project involves the construction and operation of a large-scale waste incinerator, reception, sorting and pre-treatment facilities for separately collected and mixed municipal solid waste and sludge, and a temporary storage for hazardous waste. The incinerator is to provide treatment capacity for 130kt/yr. The units will be designed to co-generate electricity and heat, the latter to be supplied to the existing district heating network of Parma. The district heating network will be extended and expanded as part of the project. The generated heat will also serve to dry the sludge prior to incineration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe projectâ€™s economic interest is linked to its contribution to improving the waste management system in the Province of Parma by reducing the amounts of untreated municipal waste sent to landfill, particularly biodegradable material. The project is part of a wider regional waste management plan, designed to further improve minimised waste production, selective waste collection and increasing the share of municipal waste subject to recovery, treatment and recycling. The plant will furthermore involve energy generation (electricity and heat) from municipal solid waste, which is in the EU and national context considered partly to be a renewable energy source.",

The project will be one of the largest wind farms to be developed in Africa and a high-profile entry to the African renewable energy sector for potential investors. MIGAâ€™s guarantee is being requested for â‚¬35 million of non-shareholder loans plus â‚¬17 million of interest and â‚¬23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus â‚¬22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEIB Project: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to CabeÃ³lica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, SÃ£o Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island.

   "Project ID P116194: This is financing for the Giza North Power Project to the Arab Republic of Egypt to expand electricity generation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project has three components. The first component is construction of the Giza North Power Plant; four 250 MW gas turbines; two 250 MW steam turbines; four heat recovery steam generators (HRSG); water systems including cooling water, condensate system (de-aerator, condenser, etc.), feed-water heaters, service water and waste water treatment; and electrical systems, including transformers and a switchyard. The second component is (a) technical assistance, including support for promotion of private sector investment in electricity generation, including selection of a private developer for the Independent Power Producer (IPP) at Dairut, which has been announced by the government (US$ 150,000); (b) development of a power sector strategy for the power sector for the next 7 to 10 years, focusing on attracting additional private investment (beyond the Dairut IPP) and associated tariff and other policies to facilitate efficient financing of investment needs (US$ 200,000); and (c) support for promotion of energy efficiency (US$ 200,000). Finally, the third component is the project financing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEIB Description: The project concerns the construction of a 1 500 MW gas-fired combined-cycle plant. The project is expected to contribute to meeting growing electricity demand with a lower environmental impact than other fossil fuel based alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is US $1,412,110,000. The financing in USD breaks down as follows:\n\n\n\nEuropean Investment Bank: $307,000,000.00, \n\n\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development: $600,000,000.00 \n\n\n\nOpec Fund: $30,000,000.00\n\n\n\nBorrower: $475,110,000.00.",

It will replace, modernise and - most importantly - fundamentally transform the existing university hospital service, thereby contributing to the reconfiguration of healthcare services across the Stockholm area. The new hospital will be built adjacent to and adjoining the Karolinska Institutet, one of Europeâ€™s largest and most respected medical universities, and will provide healthcare, research and education on a large scale, creating a highly specialist and research intensive new university hospital in close association with the Karolinska Institutet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Project will improve healthcare access, provide appropriate service capacity, and transform the University Hospital into a dedicated tertiary care centre, linked closely to high quality education and research. The hospital is the key element in the creation of a world leading life science area in the Karolinska-Norra Station-district (Stockholm Science City) promoted by the City of Stockholm, City of Solna, Stockholm County Council, Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University. At least EUR 5 billion will be invested in the area until 2025. It will contribute to generating health gain, improve human capital formation and thereby contribute towards social and economic development.",

The plants will apply parabolic solar trough technology, similar to that of the Andasol 1 and Solnova 1 and 3 projects. Through the parabolic trough collectors the energy content of solar irradiation will be collected by a heat transfer fluid, flowing in special glass tubes (receivers). The fluid will dissipate its energy onto a conventional steam cycle, which will then generate electricity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the development of renewable energy will support EU and national targets for renewable energy generation, and contribute to environmental and energy security objectives. Electricity generation from concentrated solar power will displace fossil fuel-fired generation and the associated emissions of greenhouse gases and others (SO2, NOx).",

The transmission line corridor and towers remain the same. The upgrade approximately doubles the transmission capacity, and removes several bottlenecks of power transmission inside Zambia and regionally within the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) market. The purpose of the project is to reinforce and upgrade the power transfer capability of the main transmission lines in Zambia to increase the reliability and quality of domestic power transmission service and to facilitate regional power trade between Zambia and Namibia and other Southern African Power Pool members. The project forms a part of the new SAPP north-south connection (through Caprivi link) that bypasses the heavily overloaded and unreliable network section of Zimbabwe.",

Partners include Hunt Oil, Repsol YPF, SK Energy, Marubeni. The total project cost is currently expected to be $3.9 billion making it Peruâ€™s largest foreign direct investment. The Sponsors plan to finance the Project with $1.6 billion in equity and $2.3 billion in long-term senior debt from a consortium of lenders including Inter-American Development Bank, Export-Import Bank of the United States, Export-Import Bank of Korea, SACE S.p.A of Italy, and IFC. The proposed IFC investment is an A-loan of up to $300 million for its own account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeru LNG is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project consisting of the development, construction and operation of a liquefied natural gas plant.  Peru LNG will purchase natural gas from Block 56 and 88 (Upstream Operations).  The gas will be transported through the existing, over-sized TgP gas pipeline though the jungle to KP 211 where it will enter a  newly constructed 408 kilometer, 34\" natural gas pipeline for transport to the LNG plant located at Pampa Melchorita, 105 miles south of Lima on the Pacific coast.  The plant consists of a 4.45 million tons per annum liquefaction train. The LNG will be loaded onto tankers at a marine loading terminal adjacent to the LNG plant for export to market.

These exports consist mainly of engineering services, oil field equipment, offshore platforms, drilling and well services, and upgrade and rehabilitation services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPemex is Ex-Im Bank's largest borrower. From 1998 to date, Ex-Im Bank has approved $8.3 billion in financing to support U.S. exports for Pemex's activities for a wide range of oil and gas exploration, development and processing projects. In August 2008, the Bank approved a $150 million small-business facility supporting Pemex's purchases of equipment and services from U.S. companies of 500 employees or fewer.\"",

It is Ex-Im Bank's first project financing of a combined water and power facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Al Dur project was to be financed by a private $1.5 billion commercial debt facility. However, in the face of tight global liquidity, private banks reduced their participation in the project and switched from long- to medium-term financing that will necessitate a refinancing during the first five years of debt repayment. To help fill the gap, Ex-Im Bank is extending a 10-year loan and the Korean Export Insurance Corporation (KEIC) will be making a shorter term loan of $275 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank loan was approved by the Bank's board of directors -- and loan documents were signed -- less than five months after the initial application to Ex-Im Bank by Al Dur. \"\"The facility involved some creative structuring in consideration of the tight credit markets, particularly for large, long-term transactions,\"\" said John A.

The distribution center is in Zellik, a suburb of Brussels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"This project benefited from the fast due-diligence process made possible by Ex-Im's Renewable Express program, and it is just the first of several of such projects that we anticipate this year,\"\" said John Scott, Solyndra's vice president of Global Project Finance and Business Development. \"\"For U.S. companies, Ex-Im Bank support is a valuable advantage that levels the playing field with other global financing incentives.\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx-Im Bank's guarantee is facilitating a longer loan term and a cost-effective interest rate that improved the project's commercial viability and significantly accelerated the project-finance timeline. The Bank processed this Renewable Express transaction in just 41 days from the receipt of the completed application to approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolyndra LLC designs and manufactures photovoltaic systems, comprised of panels and mounting hardware, for the commercial rooftop market. Founded in 2005 and headquartered in Fremont, Calif., Solyndra operates a state-of-the-art manufacturing complex and has approximately 1,000 employees.\"",

   "\"A consortium led by ACWA Power (a 100 percent Saudi-owned company), that includes Samsung C&T and MENA Fund, said Friday that work on the largest independent power generation project in the world at Qurayyah on the eastern coast of the Kingdom has started.\n\n\n\nThe project, to be developed on a BOO (build, own, operate) basis, will be located adjacent to existing SEC facilities and will substantially increase power supplies to the Saudi power grid.\n\n\n\nThe Qurayyah project will deliver 3927 MW of electricity to Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) commencing on June 30, 2014.\n\n\n\nThe project, the third of its type, and the largest, IPP being developed by SEC represents another major development in the Saudi power sector to help meet the rapidly increasing power demand in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nThe project company Hajr Electricity Production Company was established with the winning consortium owning 50 percent and SEC owning the remaining 50 percent.\n\n\n\nEng. Yousef AlOuhali, executive managing officer of HAJ, said from the company office in Al-Khobar, Thursday that â€œQurayyah IPP is a Greenfield Independent Power Project with a net generation capacity of 3927 MW. The design production capacity will make it the largest IPP combine cycle gas-fired power plant in the world once completed.â€\n\n\n\nQurayyah IPP comprises 6 identical groups of equipment, each delivering net output of 654.5 MW. Each group comprises 2 Gas Turbines (GTS), 2 Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and 1 steam turbine, he said.\n\n\n\nThe Qurayyah IPP Plant is designed and will be constructed to comply with all applicable environmental laws, guidelines, regulations and standards as per World Bank, IFC and Saudi Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME).\n\n\n\nSiemens will provide all major equipment and electrical systems and Samsung C&T will Engineer, Procure and Construct the project as the EPC contractor to deliver the project.\n\n\n\nOnce completed, the plant will be operated by The First National Operation & Maintenance Company (Nomac) a subsidiary of ACWA Power under a long-term operation and maintenance contract with Siemens providing parts and services for the gas turbines.\n\n\n\nAlOuhali further said the project was bid with the lowest tariff possible (21 percent lower than the nearest bidder), thus delivering over SR2 billion of savings over 20 years to the economy of the Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAlso the project has been designed with the highest thermal performance possible, more than 52 percent efficiency, or 14 percent more efficient than the traditional steam power plant existing in the Kingdom now, which makes it the most efficient in Saudi Arabia, the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\nâ€œThis high efficiency will save the Kingdom more than SR2 million/day in fuel cost, using the present world natural gas price,â€ AlOuhali added.\n\n\n\nThe project is being funded with $730 million of equity capital through an equity bridge murabaha facility provided by Arab National Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, The National Commercial Bank, Samba Capital, Saudi British Bank, and Saudi Hollandi Bank and 2.07 billion of debt funded by Arab National Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, Hong-Kong Shanghai Bank, Korea Export Import Bank, Kreditanstalt Fur Wideraufbau, The National Commercial Bank, Samba Capital, Saudi British Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and US Export Import Bank. â€“ SG/QJM\"",

   "\"The loan borrower, Gas Verde S.A., is the project owner and will operate the Novo Gramacho biogas plant located at the 140-hectare Jardim Gramacho landfill near Rio de Janeiro. One of the world's largest solid-waste landfills, Jardim Gramacho was the subject of \"\"Waste Land,\"\" an internationally acclaimed documentary that was nominated for an Academy Award in 2011. The biogas plant will convert the site's \"\"dirty\"\" methane gas (a by-product of trash decomposition that lingers for years and is more environmentally harmful than carbon dioxide) into clean, usable biomethane gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReclamation of the biogas at the site will significantly reduce passive landfill emissions to the atmosphere. Moreover, biogas from the Novo Gramacho plant will directly replace approximately 10 percent of the natural gas derived from fossil-fuel sources that is consumed at the Petrobras refinery. Total greenhouse-gas reductions associated with this project are estimated to be approximately 1.4 million metric tons annually. \"",

The amount includes a $200 million small-business facility, which will support exports from U.S. small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time, Pemex will offer Ex-Im-guaranteed bond issuances to capital markets to fund the transactions. Pemex anticipates four-to-seven bond offerings that will occur from June to September 2012. In the event the funding cost is prohibitive, Pemex may exercise the option to seek Ex-Im direct loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mexican projects involved in these latest financing transactions are the Cantarell Complex, Mexico's largest oil field; the Strategic Gas Program, one of Mexico's largest gas programs; and the New Projects of Pemex Exploration and Production (PEP), a program devoted to onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration ventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx-Im Bank's financing was necessary to enable U.S. exporters to compete for Pemex contracts against foreign companies backed by their governments' export credit agencies (ECAs). Each of the four transactions has a 10-year repayment term that matches terms offered by other ECAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPemex ranks as Ex-Im Bank's top borrower.

Furthermore, this TC will finance the preparation of the design of a Research, Development and Innovation Fund for Biofuels (FIDIB, acronym in Spanish), with the following specific objectives: i) to identify the most important areas of research and innovation in the biofuels production chain so as to promote further expansion and investment in the sector; ii) to design and implement pilot projects for the FIDIB, with particular emphasis on promoting strategic partnerships among universities, industries and financial entities to develop lines of work and research in innovation in relation to biofuels; and iii) to promote technological transfer and capacity building within the production chain of biofuels. This TC will also enable the Bank to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Government of Colombia to explore the possibility of a loan for the full-scale implementation of the FIDIB. The components to be financed in this TC are: i) Identification of the main areas of research (US $150,000); ii) Design and Pilot Implementation of the FIDIB (US$ 445,000); and iii) Technology Transfer (US$ 175,000).

Due to the dry weather conditions, the Cochabamba Valley has historically faced a water supply problem aggravated by the population growth in the region. On the other hand, the country needs to increase its generation capacity preferably from renewable sources. The whole project comprises the construction of a 120-m high rock filled and concrete face dam, a 20km tunnel for water diversion (finalized in 2005 with the financial support from the Government of Italy), a pressurized piping system (from 3.700 to 2.700 meters above sea level) that conveys a controlled water flow from the tunnel to the power plant to be built in the Cochabamba Valley. The dam construction contract ($85 million) has been awarded and the financing is in place. The works for the hydroelectric power plant, including complementary investments such as a substation and a transmission line, estimated in about $114.1 million, will be financed with a loan from the IDB.

The Companies expect to plant 7,800 hectares of sugarcane on approximately 14,000 hectares of land and produce their own electricity through a 37 Megawatt biomass-based cogeneration facility that will also sell excess electricity to the national grid. Booker Tate Limited, an international operator of sugar plantations, has been contracted by Maple to develop and manage the sugarcane lands, all of which will be harvested mechanically. The Project will source its water needs from the nearby Chira River and use a water-conserving drip irrigation system to be developed and implemented by a supplier. The Companies will operate and manage the Project. The ethanol produced is expected to be sold to the European Union and the United States markets. It will be exported through storage and shipment facilities that will be built near the port of Paita. The Companies will also be positioned to supply ethanol to the Peruvian market when a 7.8% ethanol blend in gasoline becomes mandatory nationwide. The Companies will sign a long-term marketing agreement for all their exported ethanol. The Project will be one of the first large-scale ethanol production facilities in Peru that will aim to integrate local communities in the provision of services and employment. The Project aims to make annual cash transfers to the Regional Government of Piura pursuant to a Land Purchase Agreement that will finance the execution of social development projects. The surplus electricity generated and sold to the national grid aims to help reduce Peruâ€™s dependence on fossil fuel-fired power plants. Companies and the government expect that the Projectâ€™s adoption of water-conserving drip irrigation technology will encourage the sustainable use of water resources in other agricultural activities in the region.

   "IDB project HA-T113. Before the earthquake of January 2010, the energy sector in Haiti had a number of weaknesses and existed in a state of crisis which directly affected the economic activity and living standards of the Haitian population. These weaknesses include: (i) dependence on fossil fuels for primary electricity generation; (ii) limited availability and access to electricity; (iii) significant technical and commercial energy losses; and (iv) dependence on fuel wood and charcoal, mainly used for cooking, which causes deforestation. The earthquake has exacerbated this situation and created an urgent need for a long term energy strategy that integrates short term reconstruction measures with long term goals. In 2007 the Ministry of Public Works Transport and Telecommunications, with the technical assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, produced the Haiti National Energy Sector Development Plan (NESDP). The NESDP included a comprehensive diagnosis of Haiti's energy sector in 2007, identified the key issues that needed to be addressed and proposed actions for the development of the energy sector from 2007 to 2017. This study will be taken as a starting point for the development of an energy strategy, however, it must be reassessed, reformulated and expanded, in order to take into account the impacts of the earthquake on Haiti's energy sector. Such impacts include key issues like migration to the urban areas, the shift of demand centers due to migration patterns, the reconstruction of housing infrastructure, and the opportunities offered by new technologies that can be employed in the energy sector.Consequently, the objective of this KCP is to help the Government of Haiti identify and develop a comprehensive strategy for the energy sector. This strategy will consider not only the immediate and short term measures that need to be taken to rebuild the energy sector after the earthquake, but also the medium and long term actions and reforms that could lead Haiti's energy sector toward a more efficient and sustainable system that is commercially viable, has a more diverse energy matrix and a greater service coverage.

Phase 2 consists of the drilling of additional production and injection wells, the building of steamfield infrastructure, and installation of an identical 38.8 MW turbine at a total cost of $177 million, including $20 million allocated for cost overruns, as required by the Phase 2 lenders. The IDB senior loan to PENSA and SJPIC, as co-Borrowers, will partially finance the Project, which will be co-financed by a group of multilateral lenders and development finance institutions. Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be operated as one integrated project. PENSA has a 20-year PPA with DISNORTE and DISSUR, the local, privatized power distributors owned by UniÃ³n Fenosa. Upon completion of Phase 2 of the Project, PENSA will operate a net 72 MW base-load plant that will be among the lowest marginal cost producers in Nicaragua. The Project will increase Nicaraguaâ€™s overall power generation capacity, and will represent approximately 8% of the Countryâ€™s total installed capacity. The total cost of this project is $216,000,000.",

   "IDB project GY-L1037. Experience in many parts of the world demonstrates that it is possible to reduce losses in a reasonably short period of time by carrying out energy audits, prioritizing the results and focusing on high loss areas. Energy accounting helps in devising a systematic plan for handling losses in the system. Ignoring energy audits can prove detrimental in the fight against losses.Overall, losses need to be analyzed in term of non-technical (commercial) and technical losses. It is recommended that the reduction of technical losses be included in the Strategic Loss Reduction Plan of the Utility. The new Loss Reduction Unit (LRU) is responsible for the monitoring of losses in the system and gives support in the implementation of new actions. Additional investments can help to maintain the operation of effective actions to bring down losses to acceptable levels; commercial and technical. Acceptable levels for technical losses depend on various factors: configuration of the network, physical parameters of the network, level of loading, prevalent operating voltage level etc. The acceptable technical power loss levels are in the range of 8.0% to 15.0%. The LRU reported 21.6% of commercial losses and 12% of technical losses in the Utility. Some measures to reduce technical losses can be implemented in the short-term 1-2 years and in the long-term 2-3 years. Some of these measures are: network reconfiguration, network reconductoring, load balancing, relocation of distribution transformers at load centers, augmentation of distribution transformers, addition of new distribution transformers, regular maintenance of distribution network etc. This operation along with current efforts from the Utility to curb commercial losses in a Strategic Loss Reduction Program, will contribute to reflect the impact of specific actions to bring down losses. The estimated total cost of this project is $5,000,000.",

The document will provide detail on who are the different actors involved in the process, including the definition of the areas to the realization of production, what are their roles, and what are the laws and regulations governing their actions. Also, the study intends to clearly identify and differentiate the missions and responsibilities of the different authorities, so as to avoid inefficiencies and overlap. In particular, in relation to ANP (the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) and PPSA (PrÃ©-Sal PetrÃ³leos SA, the sub-salt company) the study should consider a transition phase, where ANP will act as PPSA. Thus, the study should suggest what would be the decision-making processes and the major administrative tasks that should be incorporated into ANP which will subsequently be transferred to PPSA.These objectives are consistent with the country strategy in two key areas: (a) productivity and infrastructure ... to use public-private partnership models in new investments ... and (b) modernization of the state and institutional strengthening (as contained in the document GN-2570 of May 4, 2010).",

After being processed in food, the aÃ§ai pits are normally being dumped illegally or at a local landfill. By processing aÃ§ai residues into biomass for energy generation in Europe, organic waste methanisation is avoided. In this way, the beneficiaries will earn additional income from carbon credit sales under the Clean Development Mechanism.

The construction process has started and the Project is expected to start operations in 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh annually, on average, once operational; representing around 10% of the energy expected to be produced in Costa Rica by then.  The Project will be developed through a special purpose vehicle (Fideicomiso ReventazÃ³n or the â€œTrustâ€, a Costa Rican trust). The Trust is expected to lease the Project to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (â€œICEâ€) when operational. The Project is expected to have high economic and developmental impact in the following ways: 1) provision of critical infrastructure to support economic growth: the Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh of base-load power generation annually, or about 10% of the country's total generation, helping to meet increasing power demand driven by economic growth; 2) decreasing carbon emissions through the displacement of fossil-fuel powered generation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment consists in a US$100 million A Loan. The remaining debt financing for the Project is expected to be provided by the Interamerican Development Bank (â€œIDBâ€) and a group of international institutional investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1056.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a 305.5 MW hydroelectric plant and its associated facilities including transmission lines, substations and access roads to be located in the Province of Limon, located at 8 kilometers southeast of the city of Siquirres in Costa Rica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1049.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICE and the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica, have requested to the IDB a Second Operation under the CCLIP CR-X1005, to finance investments for the ReventazÃ³n Hydroelectric Project (RHP).The Operation is consistent with the objective of the CCLIP CR-X1005 and is included in the Borrower's investment plan for the electricity sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1086.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this TC (technical cooperation grant) is provide technical assistance in the development and implementation of the strategy adopted to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of the PHR, in particular measures envisaged to maintain biological connectivity corridor habitat biodiversity caused by the new reservoir, well, development of best practices in social and environmental assessment related to environmental compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1074. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this ordinary capital is to complete the environmental studies necessary for the financing of the Reventazon Hydroelectric Project (PHR). The 306-MW hydro project is planned for the area of Siquirres in Limon province and would use water from the Reventazon, and supply 524,000 homes. Project works include a 130-meter-high, 527-meter-wide concrete face rockfill dam, a 1.68-kilometer water transport tunnel and four Francis turbines. The PHR will increase power generation available to the Regional Electricity Market, to be sell through the transmission line that is part of SIEPAC.

This will be done in partnership with UNIDO and its Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, which is also supported by the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE). The Regional Observatory serves a tested model in the region for this type of work and IDB support to its activities will help consolidate what The Regional Observatory has managed to develop in the 11 above-mentioned countries. In addition to supporting new activities in The Regional Observatory, the support of this TC will also contribute to expanding The Regional ObservatoryÂ¿s reach to an additional 15 LAC countries (Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, and Venezuela) allowing it to eventually operate in all 26 IDB Member-countries. The additionality of this TC is its ability to produce the transparency and knowledge of each country specific market that is needed to spur investment at a level that makes a significant impact improving the energy security of the region. The three studies to be funded by this TC will accomplish this at a level not before seen in renewable energy research in the LAC region. This TC is therefore primarily linked to the UNIDOÂ¿s Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, but will be executed in close coordination with another relevant UN initiative: the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative . Both are initiatives where the IDB has publically committed to supporting LAC efforts in renewables, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. The information generated from these three studies directly supports both of these initiatives; the measurements and data provided by the studies will be essential to better prioritizing technologies per country, which projects to support, their funding and how much, and even identifying knowledge gaps, and this holds true for our work internally at the IDB as well as for those actors in each of the countries being studied where this information will be shared through regional workshops. Specifically this TC will also help projects that are in the planning stages or already approved by providing the most up-to-date financial information thus improving or confirming the financial structure of projects such as wind power generation projects in Mexico or the financial scenario of solar projects in Chile. In short, this TC is intended to provide essential market analysis that pushes forward the region's work in three areas: renewables energy, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. This TC is consistent with the BankÂ¿s GCI-9 sector priorities because helping increase the market penetration of renewable energy will contribute to an increase in the use of sustainable energy, the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and toward a reduction in poverty.",

The objectives of the Mining Environmental Restoration Project (GP) are to: (a) strengthen Government of Argentina (GOA) capacity to assess and mitigate environmental risks associated with closed uranium mines, processing sites, and related mining sector investments, in accordance with international good practice; and (b) reduce potential economic and health damages associated with a closed uranium milling site in Malargue and Mendoza. There are three components to the project. The first component is the remediation of the Malargue site. The project will fund remediation works, including the safe disposal of 710,000 tons of tailings and soils, structures to prevent groundwater contamination and dust, and measures to abate radiation and radon emissions. Contracting has been done in conformance with World Bank procedures and civil works have already begun (and as of May, 2008, the required investment is about 30 percent complete). Independent construction supervision conducted by a Bank-hired technical expert has reviewed the design and certified the quality of construction to date. The second component is the mine restoration planning and institutional strengthening. The project will provide technical assistance to study and design remediation options to clean up the additional sites, and support the environmental and social consultation processes required as per international best practice. The project will also fund an international advisory group to advice on the approaches being suggested for each site. Finally, the third component is the project management. The project implementation unit of the GP will be responsible for project implementation, reporting, project monitoring, and impact evaluation of key interventions.",

The overarching objective of the DPL operation is to balance socio-economic development with environmental protection and improvement. The operation will complement actions supported by the recently approved climate change DPL and will further pursue the general objectives of a previous Environment DPL Program, by integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies and programs of key development sectors: tourism, energy, forestry, water, agriculture, and housing as prioritized by the government of Mexico (GOM). The original Environment DPL Program supported environmental mainstreaming in four of these sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, and water); the other two (agriculture and housing) have been included at the GOM's request. Macroeconomic risks are associated with effects on the Mexican economy of: (i) a sharper slowdown of the US (and global) economy, decelerating growth of non-oil exports and reducing the flow of workers' remittances, (ii) higher levels of international commodity and food prices leading to further pressures on domestic inflation, (iii) increased uncertainty with respect to credit conditions for the access of emerging markets to the international capital markets, and (iv) declining oil production. However, several factors are in place to reduce these risks, including: a healthy financial system that has begun to expand domestic credit as a share of GDP; more dynamism in exports to non-US destinations; favorable terms of trade with high oil prices; and the further consolidation of prudent macroeconomic policies in both the fiscal and monetary realms.",

   "Project ID: P106261: The objective of the Sustainable Rural Development Project for Mexico is to promote the adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies in agri-businesses. There are four components to the project. The first component is the investments in environmentally sustainable technologies in agribusinesses. The project will promote investments in environmentally sustainable technologies in agri-businesses operating at the various stages of the production chain of agricultural products. Though the project will primarily focus on existing agri-businesses, support to new agri-businesses could be considered on a case-by-case basis, mainly for the introduction of solar thermal systems. The second component is the investment and production support services. In order to ensure quality at entry of investment sub-project proposals, this component will partially reimburse beneficiaries for the costs associated with business plan preparation for sub-projects, including the energy diagnostic when necessary. It will also provide beneficiaries with technical assistance for implementation of their proposed business plan, as well as training to integrate technologies promoted through the project in their farms and agri-businesses. The third component is the institutional strengthening. Activities to be financed by the project under this component will include assistance for policy development to address issues related to climate change and the environmental impact of sub-projects, in particular, institutional strengthening of areas within Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) that will address the targets outlined within the National Strategy on Climate Change and the President's Special Program for Climate Change (PECC). Finally, the fourth component is the project management, monitoring, and evaluation.",

The Second Programmatic Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL-2) will build upon the initial implementation of the program. The loan is one of the cornerstones of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY08-11 which fully integrates the Bank's activities for FY08-11 into the Government's ninth development plan. Measures undertaken by the Turkish administration and supported under the program are expected to contribute to sustaining the growth experienced by Turkey since 2002, generating employment, supporting the competitiveness of Turkish industry, and improving the living standards of its people. The program carries several risks. From the macroeconomic side, Turkey faces economic challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. In particular, high external financing needs, mainly in the private sector, make Turkey vulnerable to persisting international illiquidity and capital outflows. While a single-party Government with a strong parliamentary majority creates a favorable environment for reform, some political risks to the program remain, including: (i) continuing domestic political differences; and (ii) geopolitical events in neighboring regions. On the program side, all PEDPL-1 supported reforms have been implemented, and the risk of reversal is low. However, there are sector specific risks: delays in implementation of the remaining envisaged reforms, delays in attracting private investment, slow progress of energy efficiency measures contributing to continuing high electricity demand growth, and external developments that result in the policy actions failing to achieve a significant level of improvement in the electricity supply demand imbalance",

The components of the project include: the project concept was designed to provide an integrated technical and financial analysis of end-use projects to be financed by Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). To avoid lengthy and cumbersome application processes for projects that commercial banks will not be interested in financing, the National Agency for Energy Control (ANME) will work closely with PFIs to prescreen projects for financing. This set-up will also allow the integration of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (FNME) subsidies and other grants and loans from different sources in the financing plan of each project, therefore avoiding that projects do not reach financial close because of lack of one of the components of the financing plan. Technical assistance might be useful to complement lines of credit to provide support to Financial Intermediaries (FIs), Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and developers of sub-projects. However, ANME already has very strong capabilities and resources allowing it to provide the support required to PFIs in the area of business planning and sub-project evaluation. It also already benefits from technical assistance from various sources that aim at supporting skill enhancement or capacity building in matters related to financing of Energy Efficiency (EE) activities. Finally, a strong pipeline of identified sub-projects already exists. Should other sources of financing eventually arise for complementary technical assistance, the latter will mainly focus on: (a) training and capacity building of the commercial banks in the area of energy efficiency and cogeneration; (b) providing support to project developers to assist in the preparatory studies and business development assistance including technical and financial feasibility studies; and (c) support for targeted awareness and training efforts to support pipeline development efforts.",

The specific investments have been identified based on system load flow study carried out by Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPN), which analyzes growth in load and future generation expansion over a defined time period. \n\n\n\nII)Strengthening the urban distribution system will be implemented for each town through turnkey Supply and Installation (S&I) contracts, which will typically include the following sub-components: \n\n\n\n     (i) conversion of feeder network to High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) (to reduce technical and commercial losses); and \n\n\n\n     (ii) segregation of industrial feeders (to improve supply quality and accountability). Finally, the third component is the technical assistance and capacity building of transmission and distribution companies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII) Substantial Technical Assistance (TA) is required for effective implementation of the project and to support institutional development, capacity building, and governance improvement.",

The Government of Poland faces a dilemma: how can it decrease harmful emissions, while maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with the European Union (EU)-15 and do this within a constrained fiscal environment. The World Bank (the Bank) worked closely with the Government during 2009-10 to address this conundrum in preparing the 2011 report \"Transition to a low emissions economy in Poland,\"  analyzing the carbon abatement potential in Poland and the associated economic impact. The analysis identified energy efficiency and selected renewable energy investments as the priority near- to medium-term investments. Although energy efficiency options are low cost, market penetration has been limited. This DPL supports policy actions that are designed to address market rigidities. Poland faces a problem in achieving bold renewable energy targets as there is little hydropower or deep geothermal potential and solar power is expensive. Biomass applications have recently shown promise and are, along with wind power and biogas, expected to be the focus of attention in meeting Poland's 2020 renewable energy target of 15.0 percent of final energy consumption from renewable energy sources. To support the implementation of its renewable energy policy, the government has established a green certificates program that obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of renewable energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies are available from EC funds used to help decrease renewable energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions.

   "P121590  general energy is 10% of DPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key challenge is associated with the need to foster low carbon economic growth in the State, especially related to steel and iron production. Minas Gerais is the largest national producer of steel and iron, responsible for 60 percent of the national production. The State has 62 pig iron mills to supply the sector. Many of these mills use charcoal for energy and as thermo-reducing agent. However, most of the charcoal originates\n\n\n\nfrom illegal deforestation of the Cerrado biome (a mosaic of dry forests to savanna woodland). To deal with this issue, the GoMG passed the Law 18365/09, which virtually bans the use of charcoal from deforestation by 2018, as at least 95 percent charcoal consumed in the State must come from managed plantations. A key challenge, however, is that tree planting needs to start soon to meet the demand in 2018. The risk is that in response to this\n\n\n\nlaw, the industry could decide to use coal instead of the charcoal from deforestation, increasing the State's Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The State Government is concerned about this possibility and entered in a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank and the German Development Agency KfW in 2010 to develop alternatives to promote tree plantations for charcoal. A key Government objective is to create incentives and conditions for this law to be followed as originally intended, leading to a reduction of GHG emissions.",

There are two components to the project. The first component of the project is Word Bank (WB)-Supported IIGF Guarantees. The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA). The Project will provide a loan for TA in the amount of approximately $4.6 million to develop IIGF's institutional capacity to: screen, appraise and supervise IIGF-projects as a single window for all government guarantees for infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia; manage its operations; build capacity in Contracting Agencies (CAs), sponsors and other relevant parties; develop standardized documents and procedures for contracting agencies, sponsors and other relevant parties to use in preparing PPP projects and require the use of such documents and procedures in order for PPP projects to receive IIGF guarantees; and support PPP preparation activities, including feasibility studies, transaction advisory support and other activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCI Note on Coal:  Given that the GOIâ€™s Fast Track I power projects were predominantly coal plants, without significant changes to the Fast Track project list, it essentially dictated that WBG infrastructure assistance would further accelerate development of the coal industry. So far, the Fast Track I projects listed as â€œunder developmentâ€ include 40 coal power plants totaling 16.4 GW. In total, coal generation accounts for 94% of the Fast Track I generation capacity.  Moreover, the first project to receive an IIGF guarantee in October 2011 was the huge coal-powered Central Java Power Project (or Jawa Tengah Power Plant).  IIGF has also extended a guarantee to Puruk Cahu-Bangkuang Coal Railway, a US$3 billion, 385 km rail project to connect coal mines in northern Kalimantan to a port at Batanjung in southern Kalimantan.",

Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality",

   "Project ID: P108023: The objective of the Energy Efficiency Project is to improve energy efficiency in heat and power generation in selected towns in Belarus. There are three components to the project. The first component is the conversion of existing heat-only-boiler plants to combined heat and power plants. The project will convert existing heat-only-boiler plants to combined heat and power plants at six sites. All plants will use natural gas as the main fuel. The largest plant will be in Borisov with a combined heat and power (CHP) unit with an electricity capacity of about 65 MW, followed by the Mogilev combined cycle CHP plant of 15.5 MW of electricity capacity. The introduction of combined heat and power generation will improve efficiency of the plants and thus reduce gas consumption. The second component is the design and supervision consultancy. The design and supervision consultancy will be performed by Belarusian design institutes and financed by the Belarusian side. In addition, the component will also finance construction management and investment monitoring. Finally, the third component is the project Implementation and management. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will carry out the procurement, contract supervision, and financial management of the project including auditing and other fiduciary requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP133442 An additional loan in the amount of US$90 million to the Republic of Belarus for the Energy Efficiency Project. The proposed additional loan would help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities to increase the energy saving impact of the project. The project has disbursed 40% of the original loan and is now being implemented at a fast pace, such that the development objective is expected to be met a year ahead of schedule. All conditions outlined in OP10.00 for additional financing have been met. Other proposed changes include increasing the financing percentage from 80% to 100%. Expected outcomes of investments on two additional combined heat and power (CHP) plants proposed to be financed with the additional financing are an additional 54 megawatts of electric capacity and 46,700 thousand cubic meters (tcm) of gas saved, increasing current outcome indicator targets by 60% and 53% respectively.",

The main risk under this operation is related to the rising and widely fluctuating international energy prices particularly of petroleum products, which create instability in domestic energy costs and may induce the Government to suspend or only partially implement the continued pass-through of cost increases to consumers. This risk is mitigated by: (a) the Government's commitment for reform and actions to reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, invest in efficient and least cost facilities and to diversify; and (b) the existing regulations and price adjustment mechanisms for electricity services as well as for petroleum products allowing for monthly or quarterly adjustments.",

The project's main impact will be to prevent a possible catastrophe resulting from a dam failure. Such a catastrophe can result in significant loss of life and damage to property of persons living in downstream areas. It will also cause a major and prolonged fall in hydropower production that will severely affect the entire population of Albania and will likely significantly increase electricity prices in the whole South East Europe (SEE) region. Poor and vulnerable people in the region will likely suffer disproportionately from any such electricity price increases. The project consists of two main components: (1) physical infrastructure investments; and (2) technical assistance. Physical infrastructure investments include: (i) the specification and implementation of water alarm systems in the Drin and Mat River basins, and specification of an Emergency Action Plan; (ii) rehabilitation of spillways on Fierza, Koman and Vau i Dejes dams on the Drin river; (iii) rehabilitation of electromechanical equipment in the Koman dam; and (iv) implementation of Load Frequency Control system in Vau i Dejes and Fierza Dams. The technical assistance component will finance: (i) hydrology studies and water management; (ii) implementation consultants; (iii) studies for new hydropower development; (iv) financial management systems capacity building; and (v) international panel of experts on safety of Dams.",

Mali still has a very low rural electrification access rate. According to the National Directorate of Energy (DNE), in 2007 only about 17 percent of the population has access to electricity. In urban areas the access rate is about 30 percent and it is about 7 percent in rural areas. These low access rates are not allowing Mali to fully harness its economic potentials to compete fairly on international markets. Most rural households meet their lighting and small power needs with kerosene, dry cell, and car batteries. They do not have any form of modern energy for lighting or for operating equipment. This additional financing is intended to mainly finance energy services delivery sub-projects (both bottom up and top down) consistent with its initial development objective. The successful experience of the spontaneous bottom up projects under HEURA has demonstrated the potential for energy services delivery schemes in rural Mali led by local private operators. This experience needs to be sustained by adequate and predictable financing to avoid loosing the momentum created. The bottom up rural electrification approach needs to be complemented by large scale projects which have greater scaling up potential in the sense that they can deliver the majority of connections in the long run.",

   "Project ID: P114111: The objectives of the Emergency Power Response Project for Central African Republic are to partially restore reliable electricity supply to the project implementing entity's customers in Bangui, including essential service providers such as the Recipient's water company and hospitals, and improve the financial and operational performance of the sector. There are five components to the project. First component of the project is rehabilitation of Boali two hydropower stations. This component will provide for the rehabilitation and the procurement of transformers and protection devices, and the replacement of regulation devices of hydropower turbines. This component will address the lack of protection devices in the substations that put the integrity of the entire network system in jeopardy. Second component of the project is Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) Program. This component will distribute CFLs in order to reduce energy usage for lighting purposes. Third component of the project is pre-payment meters. This component would be a pilot program to introduce pre-payment meters among the main consumer categories, particularly those from whom collection rates are low. The target is to introduce some 5,500 pre-payment meters at customer premises out of about 18,000 customers. Priority would be given to the 5,000 customers who currently have no meters. This would enable Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA) to improve its cash flow, in order to start maintaining its infrastructure. Fourth component of the project is loss reduction program. This component will focus on replacing these old low-voltage distribution lines in six Bangui neighborhoods with PVC insulated aluminum cables, where technical losses are lower and theft of electricity is much more difficult, and on equipping existing and new transformers to improve the quality of service. Fifth and the final component of the project is Agence d 'Exicution des Travaux d 'Interet Public (AGETIP-CAF). This component is constituted of the fees to be paid for the services of AGETIP-CAF in procurement and financial management of the project on behalf of ENERCA, given the low fiduciary capacity of the latter.",

This project's specific focus is to rehabilitate and reinforce an existing 2,300 kilometer high voltage power transmission line from the Inga hydropower stations to Kasumbalesa at the border with Zambia, which is the backbone of the DRC power transmission system as well as the main artery for conveying power to the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) through Zambia. This high voltage transmission system is currently in poor operating condition and performs far below its installed capacity and reliability due to age and years of persistent inadequate maintenance. The project also supports an additional high voltage transmission line to the border with Zambia, on the existing alignment. In Zambia, activity complementing the project should result in reinforcement of the system's power transfer capability and improvement of its reliability within DRC and Zambia and into the SAPP. Furthermore, a modern optical fiber telecommunication system is to be installed in tandem with the power lines to enhance Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL's) power operations and electricity trade with the SAPP also the national and regional communication applications as well as interconnection capacity. The project is also a high visibility one for the Bank.

The project remains of significant importance to the OMVS member countries and shareholders of Manantali Energy Management Company (SOGEM), because the Felou hydroelectric plant is an important source of least cost power supply for regional OMVS power system. Despite the cost increase, the project remains economically and financially viable. Not completing the project will mean that the OMVS power system will be deprived from a relatively low cost power generating source and it will increase the power supply costs for the three utilities in the OMVS member states. The additional financing will enable the project to fully meet its development objectives and it will also continue to support the institutional strengthening and project management capabilities of SOGEM.

   "Project ID: P120834: The objective of the Additional Financing for the Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project (EERAP) for Tajikistan is to urgently increase the volume and reliability of the national energy supply, especially in the winter season, by supporting the implementation of the Energy Emergency Management Action Plan (EEMAP). The additional financing of US$15 million equivalent for the EERAP is being prepared in response to a Tajik Government request to International Development Association (IDA) to provide support for meeting severe energy shortages. The EERAP will be restructured with level two restructuring to address changed circumstances and the new challenges such as Tajikistan's cut off from Central Asia Power System (CAPS) and consequent needs to increase domestic power generation. The EERAP aims to: (a) ensure basic access to electricity for about 250,000 people in northern Tajikistan, and (b) increase heat and power supply to the entire country, without overdrawing or depleting hydro resources in winter. The additional financing will help finance costs associated with the following original project's activities: (i) scale-up of project activities to provide critically needed power; and (ii) a corresponding scale-up of project management support. A scale-up of the EERAP is appropriate because it supports project development objectives and aligns with the 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the 2007-08 crisis, the Government developed the Energy Emergency Mitigation Action Plan (EEMAP); its objectives were to (a) sustain thermal and heat energy \n\n\n\nsupply in the shortest possible timeframe; (b) initiate preparations for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 winters, when energy supply remained in deficit; and (c) identify medium- and long-term actions to be implemented to improve energy security. The Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance \n\n\n\nProject (EERAP) helped implement elements of EEMAP, which is now almost complete, and has met its objectives. However, Government is revising EEMAP. Suggested measures include: (a) rapid construction of transmission lines to link areas unconnected to the Tajik energy grid; (b) procure more power from IPPs, such as Sangtuda-1; (c) improve Nurek hydro reservoir management; (d) enhance efforts to reduce \n\n\n\nlosses, and (e) improve demand-side management by using more energy-saving technologies.

The additional financing provides both continuity (building up on the original project's previous successful power access efforts) and innovation (efficiency and governance issues are supported by focusing on loss reduction, in a context where improving EDD's financial performance is essential). The additional financing does not propose to pursue the diversification of generation agenda for two reasons: (i) private sector interest in wind, solar, and geothermal investments exists and can better be supported through other avenues (the Bank is already engaged with the Government of Djibouti in a dialogue on how best to mobilize investments for geothermal development); and (ii) EDD's current level of electricity losses will offset the bulk of benefits that could be obtained today from small scale diversification.

The grant for NSP III will help the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) to launch the third phase of the National Solidarity Program that is designed to: (a) continue to build and strengthen the capacity of Community Development Councils (CDCs) as key institutions to facilitate local development, service delivery and local governance; (b) support the continued program roll-out to an additional 10,320 rural communities; and (c) scale up program support to 17,400 rural communities for economic and social development schemes through provision of repeater grants to CDCs. NSP is one of the flagship development programs of the GoIRA. The project will continue the World Bank's support for NSP as part of the overall donor effort. The program builds on the lessons learned from the first and second phases of project implementation and addresses challenges to move the program forward. Donor funding support for the NSP has been largely channeled through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) with some additional support from bilateral donors. It is expected that this arrangement will continue for NSP III. Energy and mining (Power) (14%)",

The objectives of the Energy Sector Development Policy Operation Program are to contribute to reducing Tonga's fiscal deficit and to support the Government's efforts in implementing reforms in the energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and stable growth in the medium term. The program will provide budget support to reduce the near-term fiscal deficit. It will also reinforce the importance of implementation of energy sector reforms necessary to reduce Tonga's vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks, which otherwise will pose a significant risk to achieving stable growth in the medium term. Like other Pacific Island nations, Tonga is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and to external economic shocks because of its small size combined with a large distance from the nearest large market. The knock-on effects of the global economic crisis, in particular in remittances and tourism revenues, contributed to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contractions of 0.4 percent in FY2008-09 and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009-10. As the government recognized the extent to which its tax revenues had been affected by the global economic crisis last year, it took emergency measures to limit recurrent expenditures including imposing lower ceilings on the expenditures in most ministries toward the end of FY2009-2010. It also sought budget support in the form of grants from donors. While the outlook is for growth to recover in FY2010-2011 to around 1.5 to 2 percent, downside risks remain. Containing expenditure to the level set in the budget will be challenging, even with greater attention to expenditure prioritization, given the emergency-nature of the budget cuts already instituted in FY2009-10.

The Fourth Economic Reform Support Grant Program (ERSG IV) is the first in a programmatic series of two operations, designed to assist the Government of Burundi (GoB) to consolidate recent efforts to transform Burundi's economy from a post-conflict context and to formulate and implement policies to accelerate growth and promote human development. The ERSG IV operation aims to reinforce and operationalize reforms begun during ERSG II and III and will support the government to continue reforms in: (i) the public finance management system to improve accountability and transparency in public spending; and (ii) the business environment to foster private sector-led growth, particularly in the export crop subsector. At the conclusion of the ERSG IV-V programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to each component of the reform program is expected, including: (i) measurable improvements in public finance management; (ii) measurable improvements in the environment for private sector development, including as relates to the constraints posed by the energy sector; and (iii) progress in the liberalization of the productive sector, including the execution of the reform program in the coffee and tea sectors.",

The objectives of the Fourth Governance Reform and Growth Credit Program are: 1) improve the allocation and efficiency of public spending to support poverty reduction; 2) strengthens domestic resource mobilization and management; and 3) increase provision of electricity. The Development Policy Operation (DPO) seeks to support Government implementation of its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) covering the period 2008-12, known as an agenda for economic and social empowerment. In doing so it builds on a series of three previous Governance Reform and Growth (GRG) operations. PRSP-2 identifies four priorities: a) provision of a reliable power supply to the country through extensive reforms and investments in the energy sector; b) increase productivity and output in agriculture and fisheries through an array of policies including provision of research, extension, marketing and technical services to promote diversification and private sector participation; c) develop a national transportation network to promote investment and support higher economic growth; and d) increase provision of social services to improve human development and accelerate poverty reduction.

   "IBRD/IDA Project ID: P121812. The objective of the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC VI) for Cape Verde is to support the policy reforms and institutional development necessary to foster sustained economic growth. The Government of Cape Verde (GOCV) has made considerable progress in achieving its reform objectives under both the current and previous PRSC series and has completed all PRSC benchmarks. Additionally, the government has met all assessment criteria for the final review of its International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Cape Verde has built a solid reputation for good governance and responsible fiscal policy: it ranks first in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the Africa Region (Low Income Countries). From 2000 to 2008 the Cape Verdean economy enjoyed an average annual real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5 percent. In 2007 Cape Verde graduated to Middle-Income Country (MIC) status. According to the analysis that underpins the proposed PRSC VI; fiscal deficits are expected to remain high through 2012. These are largely the joint result of adverse external conditions and the temporary acceleration of public investment which reflects the strategy to take advantage of the five-year window under which the government can still tap concessional sources of financing, following Cape Verde's graduation to MIC status. As the global economy, and the Euro Zone in particular, recovers from its current recession, the Cape Verdean economy should return to a robust growth path, and, in this context, the government's long-term macroeconomic stance remains adequate. The current PRSC VI will enable the government to maintain fiscal sustainability and continue its investment program without curtailing social services or accumulating an unsustainable debt burden.

   "This operation contributes to the strategic outcomes of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) by focusing support on two Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs: growth for jobs and exports, and governance. It adopts policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support, Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support continued reforms in health and the implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature partnership between international partners and Rwanda. Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been implemented since 2008. In 2010 Rwanda continued its strong reform performance, despite the impact of the recent global economic slowdown.  (General energy sector 21%).",

This Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) operation supports two objectives: a) preserve macroeconomic stability and to improve public sector performance, and b) support broad-based growth by improving the efficiency in the energy sector and reducing the cost of doing business. The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period 2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform program and maximizing the impact of its poverty reduction strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for ongoing policy dialogue with the government and other major stakeholders; it promotes coordination between the government and the donor community and complements the continuing efforts of other cooperating partners. As a result, economic growth has not generated the expanded employment opportunities and increased income necessary for further poverty reduction. Zambia must successfully diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor sectors if the country is to make significant progress in achieving its poverty reduction goals. (Power 25%).",

   "IBRD/IDA Project ID P122806. The financial support granted to Togo would help implement the countryâ€™s economic reform agenda, and would further narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key elements of the countryâ€™s poverty reduction strategy and resources available from the Governmentâ€™s own revenues and other donor support. The World Bankâ€™s Board of Directors today approved a grant amounting to US$28 million for the Republic of Togo to support the implementation of the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-4).  This operation aims to support the implementation of economic governance reforms initiated under previous economic recovery operations granted respectively in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Most specifically, the ERGG-4 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial management and governance of key sectors of the economy. In this regard, the new operation would put an emphasis on two main pillars i.e.: (i) the strengthening of governance with the aim of improving budget formulation, execution and controls, and public procurement; and (ii) the consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth including through reforms in the phosphate, cotton and energy sectors. The reforms supported by the new operation are critical to the Governmentâ€™s ability to use public resources efficiently and effectively to support the countryâ€™s economic and social recovery.  The approval of ERGG-4 is based on a set of prior actions in the following areas: (1) Public financial management: (i) preparation of draft decrees and laws to implement the six West African Economic Monetary Union directives pertaining to public finances; (ii) publication of the 2010 quarterly budget execution reports and submission to Parliament, of the draft 2011 budget law with a medium-term expenditure framework for each of the education, health and agriculture sectors; (iii) adoption of a  treasury management planning order; (iv) submission by the SOTOCOâ€™s  liquidator, CEET SNPT and Togo TÃ©lÃ©com of their respective 2007 and 2008 financial statements to the Court of Accounts; and (v) development and operation of the procurement website, and publication and circulation of the Procurement Newspaper. (2) Cotton sector: (i) the implementation of an analytical accounting system for new cotton company NSCT which is consistent with the recommendations of the Assessment Report; and (ii) the provision of training to farmer leaders toward a better participation within the NSCT board.  The objectives are to improve the financial management of NSCT, and to strengthen farmersâ€™ representational abilities on the Board of NSCT to ensure their participation in the decision-making process. (3) Phophate sector: adoption of a detailed action plan and budget for the activities that are to be implemented under EITI-Togo; the objective is to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability, thus contributing to greater private sector and donor confidence.\n\n\n\n(4) Energy sector: adoption of the Utility Tariffs Adjustment Order. This prior action will contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of CEET as it passes-through to the consumers the tariff adjustment that CEB made in June 2009.\n\n\n\nUpon approval of the project, Madani M. Tall, Country Director for Togo, commended the Togolese government for all the efforts made to implement the prior actions for the new budget support operation, These efforts have led to the consolidation of reforms initiated in 2008 with our first budget support operation.  We strongly believe that the ERGG-4 will help continue the implementation of the countryâ€™s reform agenda to support the economic and social recovery, and help address the institutional and economic challengesâ€. Tall also commended government for efforts made to achieved the HIPC Completion point, and encourage them to pursue and intensify the reforms already started, in order to fully enjoy the benefits of the debt relief, i.e. having more facility to mobilize the resources necessary to achieve growth and reduce poverty. The program is aligned with the World Bank Interim Strategy for Togo, and also with Togoâ€™s poverty reduction strategy.  It is closely coordinated with other World Bank programs for Togo, and with the International Monetary Fundâ€™s ECF program. The Togolese Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for implementing the grant, which will be released in a single tranche.  (Power 20%).",

The objectives of Kabeli Transmission Project are: to support the addition of transmission capacity to the Integrated Nepal Power System; and to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to communities in the area of the Kabeli 132 kV transmission line. This project has 3 components. Component 1 will construct a new 132 kV transmission line in eastern Nepal, with associated technical assistance. Component 2 will install distribution lines and associated infrastructure to provide access to electricity to communities in the area of the transmission line, with associated technical assistance. Component 3 will provide access to electricity and cooking fuel through off-grid schemes in communities for which grid extension (Component 2) is not a feasible option, with associated technical assistance. The total cost of this project is $47,690,000.",

   "IBRD/IDA Project Id P125374. The Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank approved on Tuesday a $2.2 million grant to support the water and energy sectors in Guinea-Bissau. This additional grant will complement the Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project grant of US$12.7 million approved in July 2010, and will enable the purchase of a five megawatt (MW) thermal power generator.  â€œThis additional financing is important because it will enable the city of Bissau to double electricity supply from the public utility company, Water and Electricity of Guinea Bissau, thus improving the reliability of clean water supply and the business climateâ€, said Moez Cherif, Senior Energy Economist and World Bank Task Team Leader of the project.  Guinea-Bissau is facing structural deficit in electricity generation and distribution. It is currently generating about 4 MW of power on a regular basis, while the unrestricted demand for power in Bissau has been estimated at about 30 MW. â€œThe Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation project is only the first step toward larger investments and reforms of the electricity and water sectors. Other donors are also contributing to this effortâ€, Moez Cherif added.\n\n\n\nBecause of the failure of public electricity supply, there is an estimated 20 MW of private capacity installed by large consumers such as embassies, international organizations, hotels and other institutions, and around 1,000 small generators used in the residential sector. â€œThis is costly to the fragile economy of Guinea-Bissau in terms of competitiveness and has a negative environmental impact as small diesel generators are more costly and less energy efficient than larger utility-run plantsâ€, said Cherif.",

The objective of the Additional Financing for the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project is to improve the quality and efficiency of the electricity service provision in the main three growth centers of Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro and to establish a sustainable basis for energy access expansion and renewable energy development in Tanzania. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR17.20 million (equivalent of approximately US$27.88 million) to the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project. This additional financing will not entail restructuring of any of the project's components or its implementation arrangements. The current project development objective will remain unchanged and the current closing date will not be extended. The incurred delays under the on-grid part required some necessary changes to the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators. However those changes only relate to a rescheduling of the targets into future years. All activities could be implemented and targets achieved as per the original target values by the current project closing date of March 2015, recently extended because certain on-grid targets would not have been achievable in the original time frame of the project. The results framework was already updated in this regard during the midterm review of December 2010 and reviewed by and agreed with the Bank. The applicability of this updated results framework was reconfirmed during appraisal by the Bank and the borrower including validity of all its indicator values and targets.

Project Description: The Kribi gas power project is Cameroonâ€™s first IPP and will be operated by Kribi Power Development Corporation (KPDC), an affiliate of AES Sonel. KPDC will receive electricity production and sales licenses from the electricity regulator ARSEL. The Kribi project consists of a gas-fired power plant with a capacity of at least 150MW located in the Mbolongwe village, 9 km north of the coastal city of Kribi in the southern province of Cameroon. A 100 km 225 kV dual transmission line will run between Kribi and the existing Mangombe 225/90kV substation at EdÃ©a in the Littoral Province. The choice of technology for the power plant (gas engines or turbines) is being finalized. Additional investment components include the Sanaga South gas field which is being developed by a joint venture between the national oil company (SocietÃ© Nationale des Hydrocarbures - SNH) and the private company Perenco Cameroun under a production sharing agreement and financed by Perenco, and the CPF site at Bipaga and a gas pipeline linking the CPF and the power plant at Mpolongwe, financed by SNH. Gas supply arrangements between SNH and Perenco (GSA 1) and SNH and KPDC (GSA 2) are being finalized. AES Sonel will be the sole off-taker of electricity produced by KPDC under an armsâ€™ length Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) under negotiation. KPDC will sign an operations and maintenance contract with AES Sonel. The aluminum smelter, Alucam, Cameroonâ€™s single largest industrial electricity consumer, will ensure a stable base load for the project by taking up to 50MW. The beneficiary is the Government of Cameroon.",

   "Within the broad ambit of public sector reform, this series focuses on the crucial energy\n\n\n\nsector and reform of electricity in particular as this will be essential for sustained private sector\n\n\n\ninvestment and activity. In addition there is a severe under provision of electricity as reflected in\n\n\n\nthe low access ratios, variously estimated to be around 5-6 percent of the population. Given the\n\n\n\nlong term neglect that has marked the sector this endeavor is one that will require time to bear\n\n\n\nfruit.\n\n\n\nHousehold survey data show that the vast majority of the population does not use\n\n\n\nelectricity for lighting or cooking. Only 2.7 percent of households use public electricity for\n\n\n\nlighting and 91 percent of households use kerosene for lighting. Similarly, 85 percent of\n\n\n\nhouseholds use firewood for cooking, 14 percent use charcoal, and almost none use public\n\n\n\nelectricity.53 In view of these data, any short-run changes in lighting or cooking patterns that\n\n\n\nmight result from a temporarily higher electricity tariff would be quite small and would not result\n\n\n\nin any significant environmental impacts. The sustained provision of affordable hydroelectricity\n\n\n\nshould, over the long-run, induce a shift in lighting and cooking preferences towards electrical\n\n\n\nappliances that would have a substantially lower carbon-footprint than kerosene or charcoal.\n\n\n\n[Note: details are taken from the Program Document]",

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5Â°C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations.

   "P128284 (From program doc) The GGSC I will focus on three priority areas: a) fostering transparency, accountability and integrity in the budgetary framework; b) promoting good governance and efficiency in the education and health sectors; and c) enhancing private sector development through energy sector reforms.   The Government and SENELEC are also moving ahead with additional private investment in power generation, including three new independent power projects totaling about 450 MW, one of which to be supported by the World Bank Group (a dual HFO/gas 70 MW plant), as well as with further regional integration â€“ in particular to benefit from the sub-region hydropower resources and Mauritaniaâ€™s natural gas resources.  By the closing date of the proposed GGSC series, Senegal expects to achieve the following results related to the GGSC I prior actions: The undistributed energy due to load shedding decreases from 250 GWH in 2011 to 10\n\n\n\nGWH in 2015. The Government subsidies to the energy Sector decrease from CFAF99 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) in 2012 to CFAF50 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) in 2015.  SENELECâ€™s debt to equity ratio decreases from 3 in 2011 to 1 in 2015.  GGSC II Trigger: Increase private investment in electricity generation.  GGSC III Trigger: Submission to the Parliament of a new electricity law consistent with the ESPL (to modify the electricity law 98-29), \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral development partners are providing significant support to the sector: the African Development Bank is promoting private sector investment for a new 125 MW coal power plant, as well as for rural electrification; the French AFD is assisting the rehabilitation of power generation assets of capacity expansion and for rural electrification; BOAD and IsDB are financing power capacity expansion; KfW is focusing on the promotion of wind energy, as well as rural electrification concessions and household energy; EU is also supporting rural electrification projects; EIB is assisting in the development of regional hydropower projects; China is financing transmission and distribution improvements and containerized generation plants; Korean development programs are promoting a 250 MW coal power plant.

The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has begun to implement a strategy to place the power sector on a more sustainable path. The discovery of important offshore natural gas reserves presents Tanzania with a potentially transformational opportunity for the country. The Government is determined to, and has started the process of, implementing an appropriate policy framework for the optimal use of future natural gas revenues. A programmatic approach is being proposed to support the Government in addressing the above challenges. The operation is consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY12-15 and the Africa regional strategy. The development objective of the program is to: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in its power sector; (ii) reduce the cost of power supply and to promote private sector participation in the power sector; and (iii) to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's natural gas resources",

   "P144030  The development objective of the Block CI-27 Gas Field Expansion Project for Cote d'Ivoire is to maintain the availability of clean natural gas for lower cost power generation. The project has two components: The first component is upgrading of the existing foxtrot platform. Foxtrot is the only field in Block CI-27 currently in operation. Gas and a small volume of oil are transported via pipelines to the Vridi terminal in Abidjan, where the gas is sold to the Azito and Compagnie Ivoirienne de Production d?Electricite (Private IPP) (CIPREL) power stations and the oil to the Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (Ivorian Refining Company) (SIR) refinery. The supply lines and facilities that service the existing foxtrot platform will be reconfigured to ensure reliability and uninterrupted gas supply after the field expansion. The second component is addition of a new production platform, wells and pipelines to develop the adjacent Marlin field within the CI-27 block. Under this component the Marlin field will be developed as a new separate four-leg fixed platform with eight slots and five wells. The Marlin platform was ordered in February 2013, after a 2-year delay, resulting from the unstable political situation in Cote d'Ivoire, and gas payment arrears of the power sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDA guarantee - $60 million",

   "August 10, 2010 \n\n\n\n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on August 9 a \n\n\n\nbuyer's credit*2 agreement in the amount of up to 900 million US dollars with the EGYPTIAN REFINING COMPANY \n\n\n\n(TAKRIR) S.A.E. (ERC), a company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt, provided under project financing*3. \n\n\n\nThis loan was cofinanced with the following commercial banks: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (the Facility \n\n\n\nAgent); SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Tokyo Branch; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Tokyo Branch; \n\n\n\nStandard Chartered Bank Tokyo Branch, ; CrÃ©dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Tokyo Branch and The \n\n\n\nSumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., with the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing Buyer's \n\n\n\nCredit Insurance for the cofinanced portion. Besides this loan, the project has also been financed by other export \n\n\n\ncredit agencies and multilateral institutions, namely the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the European Investment Bank \n\n\n\nand the African Development  Bank. This is the first project finance loan that JBIC has provided to a project in the \n\n\n\nArab Republic of Egypt. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n2. In this Project, ERC, in which Citadel Capital S.A.E., an Egyptian investment company, and the Egyptian General \n\n\n\nPetroleum Corporation (EGPC) have equity stakes, will construct, own and operate processing units to refine \n\n\n\natmospheric residue to be fed from EGPC's existing Cairo Refinery, and will then sell diesel and other refined \n\n\n\nproducts to EGPC over the long-term. JBIC is financing ERC to construct the new processing units, the EPC \n\n\n\ncontractor for which is a joint venture which includes Mitsui & Co., Ltd., thereby supporting the export of Japanese \n\n\n\nplant facilities and machinery.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3. With many of its existing refineries equipped with simple and outdated distillation units, Egypt, an exporter of surplus \n\n\n\nfuel oil, is unable to meet domestic demand for middle distillates such as diesel and relies on imports for such \n\n\n\nproducts. The Project is aimed at substituting such imports with domestic production by installing advanced \n\n\n\nprocessing facilities. Additionally, the Project is expected to contribute to environmental improvement, as the \n\n\n\nproduction of high-quality refined products with the state-of-the-art facilities to be installed will reduce emissions of \n\n\n\nsuch air pollutants as NOx and SOx. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n4. During the fourth meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in May 2008, the \n\n\n\ngovernment of Japan pledged to offer some 2.5 billion US dollars in financial support to Africa over a 5-year period \n\n\n\nthrough JBIC operations.  This loan, which supports Japanese firms' exports to Africa, is well aligned with this \n\n\n\ngovernment policy.   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n5. When the Project was forced to reconsider its financing plan due to the credit squeeze in the aftermath of the \n\n\n\nfinancial crisis in 2008, JBIC decided to participate in this Project and helped structure effective financing in \n\n\n\ncollaboration with other public financial institutions, while drawing on its abundant experience in project finance.  To \n\n\n\ncreate export opportunities for Japanese industries, JBIC will continue its support for Japanese overseas business \n\n\n\nactivities by drawing on its expertise, risk-assuming function and wide range of financial instruments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 6, 2010 IFC project# 29128: The project consists of the construction of a 5 million ton per annum hydro-cracking and coking facility in Mostorod, Greater Cairo, by the Egyptian Refining Company SAE (â€œERCâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€) to upgrade locally available refinery atmospheric residue into lighter products, such as ultra low sulfur Euro V diesel and high octane gasoline blending component, for the domestic Egyptian market (the â€œProjectâ€). The Project will also include environmental upgrades to the adjoining facilities of state-owned Cairo Oil Refining Company (â€œCORCâ€) and Petroleum Pipeline Company (â€œPPCâ€). \n\n\n\nEgyptian General Petroleum Company (â€œEGPCâ€), a Government of Egypt (â€œGOEâ€) economic authority, and owner of both CORC and PPC, will supply most of the feedstock to the Project and off-take most of its production. The Project is seen by GOE as an important import substitution project which will address the strong deficit of lighter petroleum products in the Greater Cairo region, which represents about half of the Egyptian refined products market, and Egyptâ€™s surplus of atmospheric residue/fuel oil.",

   "IFC Project number 28035: This is financing for a 404MW combined cycle gas-powered plant expansion, owned and operated by Uch Power (Private) Limited (â€œUPLâ€), an IFC client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground: In March 2007, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (â€œPPIBâ€) requested UPL to submit a bid for a capacity expansion to the existing plant. The expansion was designed to utilize the supply of indigenous gas in the Uch Gas Field (â€œUGFâ€) and to increase the supply of low cost power to the country. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPL proposed a 404 MW combined cycle expansion project (â€œUch IIâ€ or the â€œProjectâ€) on a Build-Own-Operate (â€œBOOâ€) basis. All energy that would be produced by the Project would be sold to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (â€œNTDCâ€) under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement, backed by a GOP Guarantee. An Implementation Agreement would be signed prior to financial close that would entail the GOPâ€™s support for the project and would also lay out the rights and obligations of all parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed expansion will be structured as a standalone Independent Power Plant (â€œIPPâ€) and will be built on the site of the first plant, utilizing the available vacant land, and will use some of the existing physical and management infrastructure. The project will use the indigenous gas that is available in the UGF and is being used by the first plant. In addition to the infrastructure, the project will operate with the existing plant in the form of a shared management team as well as common utilization of O&M resources and administrative staff. The synergies are expected to result in a shorter construction period as well as reduced overall project costs, which would result in a more competitive tariff for the project. Similar to the operating 586 MW Uch-I plant, the new plant  is expected to be a low-cost producer of power in the country and would be in line with IFCâ€™s strategy to support the development of low cost thermal power and help improve sector operating costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Project will be established under a separate project company, called Uch-II Power (Private Limited), which will be established in Islamabad and will be 100% owned by IP. Headquartered in London, IP is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has regional offices in Boston, Singapore, Melbourne and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at US $500 million. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment is an A-loan for IFCâ€™s own account of up to US $100 million.",

All of the projects will be built by SunEdisonâ€™s EPC Company under a fully-wrapped EPC contract which is price and date certain and provides equipment and full-plant performance warranties for the first 2 years of operation. Beyond this the Operation and Maintenance (â€œO&Mâ€) will be provided by SunEdison O&M Services arm which will provide plant availability warranties and module supplier will provide degradation rate warranties. \n\n\n\nIFC is proposing to make up to 15 % equity contribution to the needs of the Development Company, equivalent to approximately $55 million over the coming 12-18 months. In addition IFC considers providing A Loans in the following amounts: $20 million for the Indian project and $26 million for the four small Thai projects. The expected total project cost will be approximately in the range of $300 - 450 million for the five grid tied projects being debt-financed by IFC.

This included first raising a US$2 billion debt facility to restructure its existing debt (including IFCâ€™s prior loan), then taking the Company public to access additional equity, and finally syndicating the debt facility. Kosmos may also seek to increase the facility to US$3 billion, subject to market appetite, liquidity and timing of development activities.

The blockâ€™s contingent resources on a 2C basis are estimated at 35.9 million barrels of oil (â€œmmboâ€) and 355 billion cubic feet (â€œbcfâ€). The Project (â€œRialto Energyâ€) consists of drilling 2 wells on the Gazelle area and one exploration well on a prospect in the Hippo cluster. A rig contract has been executed and long-lead items for this program are being acquired. The success of this appraisal and exploration drilling will allow the Company to make the final investment decision and proceed with the field development plan agreed with the Government of Cote dâ€™Ivoire. Once developed, hydrocarbon production from the field, particularly gas from Gazelle, will help address significant shortage of gas supply currently existing and projected in order to serve the countryâ€™s power needs.\n\n\n\nThe Project is located offshore Cote dâ€™Ivoire in the Grand Bassam area, south east of Abidjan about 10km off the coast and about 30km from the receiving plant in the Abidjan area.",

(â€œCELPAâ€) and (ii) the potential future acquisition and turnaround of other power distribution companies in Northern and Central Brazil (together, the â€œProjectâ€). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCELPA is the distribution company of the State of Para, covers a service area of 1.25 million square kilometers (the size of France, the UK and Spain combined) and serves close to 1.8 million customers representing a population of nearly seven million people as of end of 2011. CELPA was privatized and acquired by Rede EnÃ©rgia S.A. (â€œRedeâ€) in 1998.

Once the Project reaches financial close, a knowledgeable and experienced partner will step-in to restructure and undertake significant investment to improve and expand CELPA's power network, increase operational efficiencies and achieve productivity gains. In turn, the quality and reliability of the service will improve and should, over time, translate into better access to electricity for one of the poorest and most underserved regions of Brazil. In addition, industrial and commercial activities in the region, particularly agricultural activities, will directly benefit from reliable and good quality electricity.",

   "31482  Butec is a mid-size family-owned Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor based in Beirut, Lebanon, and a current IFC client. Butec established a new company - Butec Utility Services (BUS) - which has been awarded a four year Power Distribution Service Provider (DSP) contract for the Northern Lebanon region serving 350,000 households. BUS, to be majority owned by Butec, will execute the DSP contract along with several partners experienced in Power Distribution. Butecâ€™s partners on this project, including ERDF (the wholly owned distribution subsidiary of Ã‰lectricitÃ© de France), El-Sewedy (Egypt) and AT Kearney, have a track record of successful projects in countries facing similar challenges. Butec has approached IFC to provide financing for BUS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Support the reform of the power sector: IFC's strategy for Lebanon is to help the government put the country's economy on a path of sustained, high, and broad-based economic growth. An investment in a DSP as a first step towards reform has the potential to address that.\n\n\n\n 2. Promoting private sector participation: The DSP contracts are a step towards greater private participation in the power sector in Lebanon, one that fits well within the IFC's strategy for Lebanon.\n\n\n\n 3. Decrease distribution network losses: one of the main incentives behind outsourcing the operations and maintenance of the distribution network and the installation of a network of smart meters is the minimization of losses, technical and non-technical. An investment in Butec will help decrease these losses and improve the efficiency of the network.\n\n\n\n 5. Higher quality of service: upgrading the distribution network, while decreasing the losses, will increase the quality of service to the customers through wider access to the network and/or shorter load shedding periods.",

   "29007  The Project owner and developer is a Mongolian company, Oyu Tolgoi LLC (the â€œCompanyâ€) indirectly owned 66% by Ivanhoe Mines Ltd (â€œIvanhoeâ€), a Canadian public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 34% by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC, a Mongolian State owned company. The deposit, which was acquired by Ivanhoe from BHP Billiton in 2000, consists of a near surface (Southern Oyu) copper/gold orebody together with a high grade deposit (Hugo North) suitable for underground mining discovered in 2002. With resources of almost 80 billion pounds of copper and 45 million ounces of gold, Oyu Tolgoi is one of the worldâ€™s largest known copper/gold deposits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Project is being developed in phases starting with construction of a copper concentrator and associated infrastructure to support production of 100,000 tonnes per day of ore, to be sourced predominantly from the Southern Oyu open pit mine development. In parallel underground infrastructure and mine development is ongoing for the Hugo North deposit. Commercial operations from the initial open pit mining development are expected to start in mid-2013. Underground production from Hugo North is expected to commence in 2016. A potential expansion of concentrator capacity (subject to required regulatory approvals and the identification and permitting of additional water resources) to 160,000 tonnes per day of ore, is currently being studied. Mine output, in the form of copper concentrate, will be trucked along a dedicated new road to the China border, to reach the Companyâ€™s primary target market of Chinese copper smelters. Power for the initial years of operations will be sourced from China, to be replaced by an on-site captive coal fired plant, which is currently in the advanced planning phase, with initial earth site work expected to start in Spring 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi (â€œOTâ€) project is a large-scale copper and gold mine consisting of an open-pit as well as an underground mine located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The OT mining operations will be powered for the first four years by imported electricity from China.  After four years, the project Investor Agreement with the Mongolian government requires the project to source its power needs domestically. Accordingly, a brand new on-site coal-fired power plant (â€œPower Plantâ€) will be constructed which will power the mine for the long-term. The Power Plant will consist of five boilers of 150 MW capacity each, for a total of 750 MW, and will be fueled by coal from the nearby Tavan Tolgoi coal mine.   http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Tolgoi_assessment_Final.pdf?docID=11801\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total project cost $7.1 billion. The coal plant cost $500 million, representing 7% of project costs.  Coal accounts for 7% of the IFC's $400 million or $28 million.  http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-13/mongolia-seeks-investors-for-thermal-plant-to-power-oyu-tolgoi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFCâ€™s  investment is a $400 million senior A Loan together with a B Loan of up to $600 million loan to be syndicated to international commercial banks, as part of a proposed $4billion project debt financing. Co-arrangers of the proposed debt financing are European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Export Development Canada (EDC), Standard Chartered Bank, BNP Paribas, US Export Import Bank (US EXIM), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).",

The Project includes the construction of a 2.8 km-long transmission line. Aura is being developed by Gauss EnergÃ\u00ada (â€œGaussâ€), an independent Mexican energy consultancy/developer and will be 100% owned by Corporacion Aura Solar, (â€œCASâ€). The Project will be constructed and operated under an EPC contract with an experienced engineering firm and PV panels will be supplied by a top-class PV manufacturer. Construction will last approximately 8 months and Aura is expected to be commissioned by August 2013.  Mexican sole power utility CFE will act as off-taker of the Project under a 20-year  take-and-pay and will pay Aura Solar the applicable Short Term Marginal Cost or â€œCosto Total de Corto Plazoâ€ at the La Paz node. Aura is the first private utility scale project to be developed under this framework and the largest PV solar plant to be built to date in Mexico. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Project will contribute to increase the share of clean and renewable energy in Mexico, specifically in BCS, an area mainly powered by fossil fuel generation. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Project will contribute an additional 30 MW towards Mexico's stated target of achieving at least 35% penetration of renewable energy and other \"clean\" power generation sources in its energy matrix by 2025. Given its location in Baja California Sur (BCS) and the State's current energy matrix, the Project will substitute the carbon-intensive HFO and diesel -fired power generation delivered to approx 160,0000 inhabitants with a clean, renewable energy source, and will displace approx. 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy reducing the reliance on imports of fossil fuels to BCS, the Project is also expected to significantly reduce environmental risks associated with transporting such fossil fuels through environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Sea of Cortez . In addition, the Project is estimated to generate approx. 150-200 direct-employment positions during its construction period.",

   "33025  ContourGlobal (CG) is a global developer and operator of power generation businesses. CG currently owns over 30 power plants around the world totaling approximately 2.8 GW of installed capacity and projects under construction by YE 2013. These include thermal (fueled by natural gas, diesel, fuel oil and coal), wind, solar, and hydro types of power generation. CG also owns and operates small captive energy generation facilities on-site for commercial beverage bottling companies worldwide. IFCâ€™s proposed loan of up to $150mm and syndication of up to $100mm for a total of $250mm would support future CG growth through a combination of greenfield engineering and construction and acquisition of existing facilities. The use of proceeds would be restricted to IFC countries of operation and will exclude any investment in coal-fired power plants. Opportunities for greenfield projects consist of wind, hydro, and solar power in South America and Africa; thermal power in Africa, and thermal power in Southeastern Europe. Potential acquisitions include opportunities in Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCG is planning to invest an average ~US$650 million over the next three years as the acquisition and development projects in its pipeline reach financial close. This will be financed by IFCâ€™s loan as well as from dividends from its existing operating companies. \n\n\n\n The proposed IFC investment is a US$235 million, comprising: i) a US$135 million senior secured loan for IFCâ€™s own account and ii) up to $100 million in parallel or B loans.",

   "33120   The proposed project is to build and operate around 500 liquefied natural gas (â€œLNGâ€) fueling stations with an objective to make LNG available as a cleaner and cheaper substitute of diesel for long-haul buses and heavy trucks along the key transportation lines across 14 provinces in China (the â€œProjectâ€).  A typical LNG truck will have 90% fewer NOX and PM emissions than a diesel truck, 100% fewer SOX emissions, and 30% fewer Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. LNG fuel also enjoys very favorable economics over petroleumâ€“ with fuel cost savings typically reported in the 30% range as compared to diesel. The objective of the Project is to, together with other similar projects currently undertaken by other gas distribution companies, build a country-wide LNG distribution network in China that will make LNG available to thousands of long-haul buses and heavy trucks along the major inter-province highways and it is expected that the increased availability of the LNG will stimulate a broad conversion of heavy trucks and long haul buses from traditionally being diesel powered to gas powered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sponsor of the Project is ENN Energy Holdings Ltd (â€œENNâ€), formerly known as Xinao Gas, an existing IFC client and a leading gas distribution company in China. ENN is registered in Cayman Islands and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ENN was founded in 1993 and is one of the largest privately-owned gas distribution companies in China operating almost 20,000km of city gas distribution networks in 14 provinces/municipalities in Eastern and Central China, serving a connected population of about 53 million in 110 cities, with 7.4 million household connections and 27,000 commercial and industrial users. ENN Group employs 22,000 people in over 100 subsidiaries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Wang is co-founder, Chairman, and a controlling shareholder of ENN. He and his wife, Ms. Zhao Baoju, collectively own 30.11% of ENN, largely through their ownership of ENN Group International Investment Limited, a BVI-domiciled company.

   "Page 1 of 2 \n\nhttp://www.jbic.go.jp/en/about/press/2008/0616-01/index.html \n\nJune 16,2008 \n\n1. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Koji Tanami) signed today a loan agreement totaling up \n\nto US$3.7 billion in project finance*1 with Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (CEO: Ian Craig), the project \n\nexecutor, for the Sakhalin II (Phase 2) Project off the coast of Sakhalin Oblast, Russian Federation.  The loan is \n\ncofinanced with a syndicate of the commercial banks, with the syndicate providing finance in the aggregate amount \n\nof up to US$1.6 billion. \n\n \n\n2. Under this large-scale project, Sakhalin Energy, in which Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corporation, Gazprom, a \n\nstate-owned enterprise of Russia boasting the largest natural gas reserves in the world, and the oil giant Shell have \n\nequity stakes, undertakes the oil/natural gas development and production in two mining fields of Piltun-Astokhskoye \n\nand Lunskoye off Sakhalin Island.  The proceeds of the loan will be applied to the construction of a marine platform, \n\nconstruction of oil and gas pipelines, and construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant.  The project is \n\nexpected to produce around 9.6 million tons of LNG annually, of which more than 50% (equivalent to approximately \n\n8% of Japan's total LNG imports) will be delivered to Japan.  With regard to crude oil, around 150,000 barrels will be \n\nproduced per day (equivalent to some 4% of Japan's total oil imports) under the project, of which a substantial \n\npercentage will be supplied to Japan. \n\n \n\n3.  Given Japan's heavy reliance on the Middle East for energy resources, this project is expected to contribute to the \n\ndiversification of energy suppliers for Japan.  Especially with regard to LNG, the supply from Indonesia, one of the \n\nlargest suppliers for Japan, is projected to decrease considerably over the coming years, and expectations are \n\nrunning high for this project to newly assume the status of major supplier.  The project is therefore considered to \n\nplay an important role in attaining Japan's policy goal of securing a stable supply of energy resources.  Furthermore, \n\nlocated in Russian Far East, the project has the geographical proximity to Japan, and thus greater implications in \n\nterms of Japan's energy security.  Taking these project effects into considerations, JBIC has decided to support this \n\nproject through the provision of the loan. \n\n \n\n4. Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation have held interest in this project for many years (combined total: \n\n22.5%), and have engaged in large-scale energy resource development jointly with Gazprom (50% plus 1 share) \n\nand Shell (27.5% minus 1 share).  JBIC supports Japanese firms' overseas resource development operations \n\nthrough the provision of this loan.  Since Gazprom, Russia's state-owned enterprise taking pride in the world's \n\nlargest natural gas reserves, takes part in this project, JBIC is expected to strengthen ties with a natural gas- \n\nproducing country through assistance activities, thereby contributing to the securing of Japan's energy resources. \n\n \n\n5. Since the project is located near Hokkaido, stakeholders in Hokkaido have expressed concerns over possible \n\nproject impacts on the environment.  In an effort to ensure that these concerns are reflected in the measures \n\n(including the oil spill response) which will be taken due to environmental and social considerations, JBIC has been \n\nworking with Sakhalin Energy, and will continue to do so through the monitoring of the project for the coming years. \n\n \n\n6.  In celebration of the signing of the loan agreement, JBIC received the following comments from stakeholders of this \n\nproject: \n\n \n\nMitsui & Co., Ltd. \n\nI firmly believe that the Sakhalin II Project, the first LNG project in Russia, will make a large contribution to energy \n\nsecurity in the Asia and Pacific region, including Japan, and that the signing of this loan agreement will pave the way for \n\nthe further development of the Japan-Russia relationship.  I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the hard \n\nwork and perseverance shown by the banking syndicate lead by JBIC, Sakhalin Energy, LNG buyers, Gazprom, Shell, \n\nMitsubishi Corporation, and all parties concerned, which have made this signing possible. \n\n(Mr. Shoei Utsuda, President and CEO, Mitsui & Co., Ltd.) \n\n \n\nMitsubishi Corporation \n\nThe latest signing of the loan agreement has great significance for the Sakhalin II Project, and, as a shareholder of \n\nSakhalin Energy, our company welcomes the signing.  Mitsubishi Corporation will continue to make its utmost efforts, \n\nalong with other shareholders, to help Sakhalin Energy grow and obtain sufficient confidence of users and stakeholders \n\nas an energy supplier.  \n\n(Mr. Yorihiko Kojima, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Corporation) \n\n \n\nHokkaido Fisheries Environmental Centre\n\n7/6/11 9:25 PM \n\nJBIC | JBIC Signs Loan Agreement for Sakhalin II (Phase 2) Project \n\nCongratulations on the signing of the loan agreement totaling US$3.7 billion between JBIC and Sakhalin Energy.  The \n\nSakhalin II Project will play an extremely significant part in both Japan's energy security and the future development of \n\nJapan-Russia relationship.  We would like to pay respects to the decisive step that JBIC has taken for the project.  On \n\nthe other hand, it is undeniable that the implementation of the oil and gas development project in Sakhalin, an \n\nimmediate neighbor of Hokkaido, will entail negative impacts and risks for local populace.  Residents engaged in fishery \n\nin Hokkaido, including staff of this headquarters, are seriously concerned about oil spills and other accidents, which \n\ncould happen due to troubles in the peripheral facilities or during transportation of crude oil and LNG in the coastal \n\nwater body off Hokkaido, since shipping would intensify to an unprecedented level as the project progresses.  Against \n\nthis background, it is truly heartening for us to know that JBIC, in the capacity of a responsible governmental financial \n\ninstitution, has decided to assume a position, as a major lender, of using appropriate and official leverage on the project. \n\nWe have high hopes that JBIC will pay sufficient attention to our concerns, provide guidance and supervision to Sakhalin \n\nEnergy, the project executor, and make appeals to relevant government agencies. \n\n(Mr. Masao Hirano, Chairman) \n\n \n\n(Cf.) \n\nThis project has been implemented in a phased manner, with Phase 2 following Phase 1.  JBIC provided a loan totaling \n\nUS$116 million to finance the Project Phase 1 (December, 1997).  The proceeds of the loan were applied to crude oil \n\nproduction at the simple maritime production facility in the Astokhskoye structure.  Production started in July, 1999, albeit \n\nonly during the summer season, recovering 90,000 barrels per day at the peak time.",

   "June 25, 2008 \n\n1. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Koji Tanami) signed on 24 June a loan agreement \n\ntotaling up to US$1 billion with Woodside Finance Limited, a financial subsidiary of Australia's largest oil and gas \n\nexploration company Woodside Petroleum Limited (Woodside).  The loan was provided through cofinancing with a \n\nsyndicate of eight private financial institutions (lead arranger: Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) which has signed \n\na loan agreement totaling up to US$500 million with Woodside Finance Limited.  The aggregate loans will finance \n\nthe Pluto LNG Project in Western Australia. \n\n \n\n2. This is a joint project of Woodside, the Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. to develop the Pluto \n\nand Xena gas fields off Karratha in Western Australia, transport gas through an undersea pipeline to a liquefied \n\nnatural gas (LNG) plant to be constructed in the Burrup Peninsula and produce and sell LNG.  The proceeds of the \n\nloan will be applied to gas field development, and construction of a pipeline, an LNG plant, and loading facilities. \n\nKansai Electric and Tokyo Gas will purchase 3.75 million metric tons of LNG per year, approximately 90% of LNG \n\nproduced by this project under at least 15-year period sales contracts. \n\n \n\n3. The prospects of global energy balance are increasingly uncertain due to various reasons such as rapid demand \n\ngrowth in the emerging economies.  Considering this development, Australia, given its geological proximity to Japan \n\nand stable politics and economy, is increasingly important for Japan as a resource supply country.  This is \n\nparticularly true of natural gas, since LNG imports from Indonesia, its current largest supplier to Japan, are projected \n\nto decrease significantly in the near future.  In these circumstances, this project has a major significance for Japan's \n\nenergy security as this project will serve as a new large supply source for Japan. \n\n \n\n4. The three companies, Woodside, Kansai Electric and Tokyo Gas, are jointly undertaking the large-scale natural gas \n\ndevelopment project.  This loan also aims to support the resource development business of Japanese electricity and \n\ngas companies for helping its effective and efficient implementation.  Woodside is an important energy firm for \n\nsecuring a stable supply of energy resources to Japan, operating the North West Shelf Venture that has annually \n\nsupplied around 10 million metric tons of LNG to Japan for more than 20 years.*? This loan for the Pluto LNG \n\nproject is expected to strengthen relations with Woodside and to contribute to a more stable supply of energy \n\nresources.",

The loan is co-financing by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (lead arranger), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mizuho Corporate Bank, The Ibaraki Bank, Higashi-Nippon Bank, and The Hiroshima Bank with JBIC providing a guarantee for their co-financing portion.\n\n \n\nThe loan will finance the projects undertaken by ESKOM, for its Northern Grid Transmission Projects which aim to strengthen the existing transmission network and further expanding it. The projects will ensure that the growth within the Limpopo province is sustained. \n\n \n\nJapanese automobile companies and other manufacturers have been paying growing attention to South Africa in recent years, as an export hub for Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  The country also exports large volumes of rare metals to Japan, such as platinum, nickel and chrome ore.  In addition, a number of Japanese companies are engaging in resource development in South Africa. The planned projects will ensure that there is sufficient electricity supply to the Limpopo province that will support the mining and rural development projects.  Thus the development of power infrastructure is an urgent issue not only for South African companies but also for the locally operating Japanese companies.\n\n \n\nThe South African government launched the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA) in February 2006. ASGISA objectives encompass creating jobs, alleviating poverty, improving service delivery and promoting good governance. ESKOM supports ASGISA by creating jobs, growing its asset base, training new learners and exploring opportunities to increase local content. ESKOM is pushing ahead a large-scale power generation and transmission/distribution infrastructure development program to meet ever-increasing power demand.  Considering the importance of South Africa to Japan, JBIC signed the Declaration of Intent (DOI) on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with its government in December 2006 to support the ASGISA*1.  Based on ASGISA, JBIC signed the Untied Loan to finance the transmission projects in June 2007*2. This loan follows on from the existing loan. Also this loan is part of JBIC's efforts to cooperate with the South African government in addressing the country's important policy agenda based on this strategy. The loan is also expected to strengthen the relationship between South Africa and Japan.\n\n \n\n In the TICAD IV, the Government of Japan announced JBIC's specific financial support for Africa. The total financial support will amount to US$2.5 billion over the next five years. JBIC will remain committed to further improvement of the business environment in South Africa. \n\n*1Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with the Government of South Africa (PDF: 19KB)\n\n*2Power Transmission and Distribution Projects financing in South Africa  (PDF: 17KB)\n\n\n\nJBIC portion of the lending ´4.5 billion, p.76, JBIC Annual Report 2009",

Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Koji Tanami) signed on August 5 a loan agreement totaling up to US$1,500 million in project financing*1 with Ras Girtas Power Company (RGPC), a Qatar corporation, to finance the Ras Laffan C Power and Desalination Project.  The loan is co-financed with financial institutions, including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Islamic financial institutions. \n\nThis is, for JBIC, the first loan in project financing, co-financed with Islamic financial institutions for Qatar.*2 \n\n2.  In this project, RGPC, which Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc. and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. established jointly with Suez Tractebel S.A., a Belgian energy infrastructure company, Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Electricity & Water Company Q.S.C., will construct a natural gas-fired combined thermal power plant (capacity: 2,730MW) and a water desalination plant (capacity: 63 million gallons per day) in Ras Laffan Industrial City located in northeastern Qatar.  The project employs a BOT scheme,*3in which electricity and water generated under the project will be sold to Qatar General Electricity & Water Corporation (Kahramaa) for 25 years. \n\n \n\n3. Demand for electric power and water has been increasing in Qatar due to sharp population growth and rising \n\nindustrial demands including in the petrochemical sector, and it is anticipated that their demand will increase by about 10.8% and 9.5% per annum respectively until 2015.  The Project is expected to make up approximately 30% and 20% of the country's total electrical generation and water supply capacity respectively in 2012 and play an important role as its major supply source of electricity and water. \n\n \n\n4. Amid the tightening demand for natural resources across the world, it is important for Japan to strengthen its relationship with the countries with reserves of natural resources.  Qatar boasts not only the world's third largest natural gas reserves; the country is also the fourth largest LNG supplier (12%) to Japan and one of the most important sources of resource for Japan.  In this light, JBIC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on \n\ncomprehensive strategic partnership with Qatar Petroleum in November, 2006.  This loan, which was realized \n\nfollowing a number of consultations based on the MOU, will contribute to the development of the power and water \n\nsector infrastructure in Qatar, which is urgently called for to ensure Qatar's stable economic growth.  It will also deepen the multi-layered cooperative relationship between Japan and Qatar by supporting this IWPP project*4 in which Japanese firms have participated.",

   "September 29, 2008 \n\n1. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Koji Tanami) signed on September 25 a loan agreement \n\ntotaling up to US$500 million with Egyptian Offshore Drilling Company S.A.E. (EODC).  The loan was provided in \n\ncofinancing with a bank syndicate led by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited(HSBC), Tokyo \n\nBranch and others as lead arrangers.  \n\n \n\n2. The loan will finance a project where EODC procures equipment necessary for developing offshore gas fields in \n\nEgyptian waters, and offers it in the long term for use in gas development.  This is a Japanese company-led \n\ninvestment project undertaken by EODC, a project company set up by Toyota Tsusho Corporation and two \n\ngovernmental oil and gas companies: the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and Ganoub El-Wadi \n\nPetroleum Holding Co. (GANOPE).  \n\n \n\n3. Oil production in Egypt has been declining since the first half of the 1990s.  International Energy Agency (IEA) \n\nprojected that the country could shift towards being a net oil importer around 2015.  By contrast, its natural gas \n\noutput has been increasing at a fast pace in recent years, turning it into a net exporter of natural gas in 2004. \n\nCurrently, Egypt ranks as the 17th largest natural gas producer in the world, according to the BP Statistical Review \n\nof World Energy 2008.  In this context, the Egyptian government aims to expand natural gas production and \n\nexports.  However, brisk resource development activities have caused a shortage of drilling rigs and other equipment \n\nindispensable for gas development.  The project will alleviate this bottleneck to expansion in natural gas production, \n\nthereby making a significant contribution to Egyptâ€™s energy policy to expand production of natural gas for exports.  \n\n \n\n4. Given increasingly tight global supplies of resources, strengthening ties with resource-endowed countries is high on \n\nthe Japanese agenda.  Against this background, JBIC signed in September 2007 Memorandums of Understanding \n\n(MOU) aimed at strengthening mutual ties with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and EGAS to build \n\ncooperative relations for developing the oil and gas businesses in Egypt.  This loan scheme relies on the \n\ncreditworthiness of EGPC and EGAS as part of the measures to secure the loan.  JBIC intends to promote dialogue \n\nand further enhance business relations with them through consultations based on these MOUs. \n\n \n\n5.

   "December 30, 2008 \n\n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on December \n\n25 a loan agreement with P.T. Central Java Power (CJP), a company incorporated in Indonesia in which Sumitomo \n\nCorporation has ownership interests, to provide project financing*2  to fund Tanjung Jati B Coal-Fired Power Plant \n\nExpansion Project.  The overall loan amount totaling up to Â¥160 billion was provided through co-financing with the \n\nthree lead arrangers, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the Tokyo \n\nBranch of BNP Paribas Bank, with JBIC providing a political risk guarantee for the co-financed portion. \n\n \n\n2. In this project, CJP will construct an additional 1,320MW power generating plant (660MWÃ—2 units) so as to expand \n\nthe capacity of the currently operating Tanjung Jati B Coal-Fired Power Plant, which was also funded by JBIC and \n\nthe co-financing lenders*3 , in Jepara, Central Java. CJP will lease the plant to P.T. Perusahaan Listrik Negara \n\n(PLN), a state-owned electricity company, for 20 years. \n\n \n\n3. According to the long-term power sector plan of Indonesia, the countryâ€™s power demand is projected to grow at an \n\nannual average rate of approximately 7.0% through 2016. Serious shortfalls in power supply conditions relative to \n\ndemand are thus foreseen, unless electricity generating capacity also increases. Since this project is an expansion \n\nproject of an existing power plant, its ancillary infrastructure is already in place. Therefore, the power plant will be \n\ncompleted in a relatively short period and will contribute to increasing Indonesiaâ€™s power supply capacity, which will \n\nalso lead to a better investment climate for Japanese companies operating in Indonesia. \n\n \n\n4. This is the first project signed within the framework of the Umbrella Note of Mutual Understanding (UNMU) on \n\nIndependent Power Producer (IPP) Projects signed by JBIC and the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia in September \n\n2006.*4?JBIC intends to contribute towards further strengthening the economic relationship between Japan and \n\nIndonesia under such policy frameworks as UNMU, while supporting Japanese industries in maintaining and \n\nimproving their international competitiveness by facilitating effective project structuring and utilizing a variety of \n\nfinancing techniques to implement JBICâ€™s risk-taking functions.",

(U1) (UUU.TO), a major, Canadian-listed producer \n\nand marketer of uranium. TEPCO, Toshiba and JBIC have agreed to subscribe to a new share issue of 117 million \n\nshares in U1, at a price of Cdn$2.30 per share, equal to approximately Cdn$270 million (about 20.2 billion yen*1) in \n\ntotal. Concurrently, TEPCO, Toshiba and JBIC have also signed a strategic relationship agreement (SRA) with U1, and \n\na Uranium Offtake Agreement. \n\n \n\n?The full share issue will be taken up by Japan Uranium Management Inc. (JUMI), a special purpose entity established \n\nby the three Japanese companies in British Columbia, Canada. Once JUMI completes the transaction, U1's outstanding \n\nshares will total 586.61 million, and JUMI will have a holding of about 19.95%. TEPCO and Toshiba will each hold 40% \n\nof JUMI's shares, and JBIC will hold 20%. \n\n \n\n?In order to further deepen and develop their long-term strategic relationship with U1, the three Japanese companies \n\nintend to appoint two representatives to serve on U1's board, and to send other personnel to the company; establish a \n\njoint committee to discuss strategic issues; and evaluate opportunities to jointly develop uranium resources. The \n\nJapanese companies and U1 will together develop and execute detailed action plans based on the SRA. \n\n \n\n?TEPCO operates a large scale nuclear generation program in Japan, and pursues economically efficient means to \n\noptimize its uranium procurement, including diversification of procurement channels, and will continue to enhance its fuel \n\nprocurement activities, especially in front-end domains. \n\n?Toshiba strives to take advantage of every opportunity to promote initiatives and programs to satisfy demand for \n\nuranium for the Group's utility customers on a global basis. \n\n?JBIC aims to support activities to secure uranium resources for Japan and to maintain and improve international \n\ncompetitiveness within the nuclear industry of Japan. From this perspective, JBIC supports this first-ever equity \n\ninvestment by Japanese companies in a major uranium company as a joint investor, and seeks to sustain U1's \n\nbusinesses by drawing on its own experience and capabilities, based on an existing relationship, to have dialogue \n\ndirectly with Kazakhstan where U1 has mining sites.",

The Project is a large-scale LNG project, and its participating parties include Exxon Mobil Corporation, Nippon Oil \n\nExploration Limited, Oil Search Limited in PNG, Santos Limited in Australia and the PNG Government. It plans to \n\nproduce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year, as well as crude oil by developing oil and gas fields in the upstream, \n\nlaying pipelines and constructing LNG liquefaction facilities. About one half of the LNG produced in the Project is \n\nexpected to be supplied to Japan. \n\n \n\n3. Given the prospect of a declining supply of LNG from Indonesia, Japan's largest LNG supply source, and emerging \n\ndemand for LNG from such countries as China and India, it is increasingly important for Japan to diversify its LNG \n\nsupply sources and secure new supply sources. Under these circumstances, this loan will support a stable long- \n\nterm supply of energy resources to Japan by financing the first LNG project in PNG. \n\n \n\n4. In this Project, Nippon Oil Exploration Limited has participating interests in energy resource development. Thus the \n\nloan will support an overseas resource development project undertaken by a Japanese firm.

Arabian Oil Company Ltd., one of Japan's oil and gas development companies, has increasingly focused on the \n\nacquisition of interest in new oil fields in recent years, since the terms of interests are expiring for the existing oil \n\nfields the Company possesses in the Middle East and Asia. This project is therefore considered one of the \n\nCompany's flagship missions. In the meantime, Norske AEDC AS has a 5% interest in the Gyda oil field currently \n\noperating in the Norwegian territory of the North Sea. The project is also expected to help expand the scope of \n\nArabian Oil Company's business operations in this region. \n\n \n\n4. In this project, the public sectors team up to assist a Japanese company in the development and acquisition of \n\ninterest in resources. JBIC will keep providing financial support for facilitating the development and acquisition of \n\ninterests in important natural resources by drawing on its various financial tools and risk-taking functions.",

   "Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Project",
   "(1) Background and necessity of the Project\n\nSri Lanka's Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (2002-2016) estimates that peak demand in 2008, when this project is scheduled to begin operations, will reach 2,346 MW (actual demand in 2000 was 1,404 MW). The plan thus calls for a total facility capacity of 2,909 MW (actual capacity as of 2000 was 1,777 MW) to be secured by 2008.\n\nAccording to the plan, the installation of hydropower plants will provide an additional 220 MW of electricity, of which 70 MW will be provided by the Kukule Hydro Power Plant (ODA yen loan provided in July 1994), and 150 MW will be provided by this project.\n\nMost of Sri Lanka's hydropower resources have already been developed, making this project the last of the new large-scale hydropower plant projects. To expand Sri Lanka's power-generating capacity and to ensure a stable power supply that is not affected by the weather, there are plans to direct efforts toward the development of thermal power generation and thus to shift to a more balanced structure of electric power generation. However, since Sri Lanka is a country that lacks its own sources of fuel, it is important that it fully develop its hydropower sources, and this project is highly necessary for achieving this goal.\n\n(2) Purposes and description of the Project\n\nIn the Philippines, roads provide the principal means of transport, accounting for around 90% of the movement of people and approximately 50% of the transportation of goods. Looking at the current state of roads in the Philippines, the national arterial roads -- the key part of the road network -- and the national secondary roads (roads linking arterial roads with regional cities, towns, and villages) have been relatively well maintained overall on the quantitative (distance) side with investment up to the start of the 1980's concentrated on road extensions. However, many unpaved roads and decrepit simple emergency bridges still remain. Permanent bridges, too, are crumbling, breaking down, and deteriorating due to such factors as inadequate maintenance, the increase in overloaded vehicles and traffic volume, and the effect of natural disasters. With disasters like frequent typhoons prevalent, the road network is also in danger of severance as bridges are washed away or collapse. Because of these factors, the local regions lack a safe and efficient road network. The improvement of qualitative conditions is urgently needed, including the paving of unpaved roads and replacement of emergency bridges with permanent ones. To promote the interchange of people and distribution of goods within the nation and support the development of urban regions, the Philippines urgently requires the development of a safe and efficient arterial road network.\n\nBy replacing a total of 201 aged bridges on national roads that lead to urban centers all over the country, this project aims to contribute to safe and efficient distribution, and in turn, support the development of regional economies.\n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used for civil works and consulting services (detailed design, assistance in procurement, etc.).\n\nThe executing agency is the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) (Address: Bonifacio Drive, Port Area, Manila, Philippines, Phone: 63-2-304-3804, Fax: 63-2-304-3805).",

The loan is co-financed with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\n \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used by VINACOMIN to ensure the stable supply of anthracite coal*2 to Japan.  More specifically, JFE Steel Corporation and Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. will sign a long-term offtake contract for anthracite coal with VINACOMIN to secure delivery of anthracite coal over the period of this loan.\n\n \n\nVINACOMIN is a state owned enterprise operating in many different sectors including the production and sale of coal and mineral resources and the operation of coal-fired power plants.  It is also one of the major suppliers of anthracite coal in the world.  Japanese steelmakers have traditionally relied on Vietnam and China for their supply of high-grade anthracite coal.  Given that China has today become a net coal importer, VINACOMINÕs importance as an anthracite coal supplier to Japan is ever increasing. \n\n \n\nJBIC has worked closely with VINACOMIN on this financing, based on the memorandum of understanding (MOU)*3 that the two parties signed in January 2009 on the occasion of the second Japan-Vietnam Coal and Mineral Resources Policy Dialogue.  JBIC will strive to build a multilayered cooperative relationship with Vietnam through stronger ties with VINACOMIN.  JBIC is committed to supporting the development and acquisition of resources that are strategically important for Japan through project structuring that draws on a variety of financial instruments and risk-taking functions.  \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui). \n\n*2 Anthracite is a high grade and rare coal having the highest carbon count.

The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on August 9 a \n\nbuyer's credit*2 agreement in the amount of up to 900 million US dollars with the EGYPTIAN REFINING COMPANY \n\n(TAKRIR) S.A.E. (ERC), a company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt, provided under project financing*3. \n\nThis loan was cofinanced with the following commercial banks: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (the Facility \n\nAgent); SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Tokyo Branch; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Tokyo Branch; \n\nStandard Chartered Bank Tokyo Branch, ; CrÃ©dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Tokyo Branch and The \n\nSumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., with the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing Buyer's \n\nCredit Insurance for the cofinanced portion. Besides this loan, the project has also been financed by other export \n\ncredit agencies and multilateral institutions, namely the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the European Investment Bank \n\nand the African Development  Bank. This is the first project finance loan that JBIC has provided to a project in the \n\nArab Republic of Egypt. \n\n \n\n2. In this Project, ERC, in which Citadel Capital S.A.E., an Egyptian investment company, and the Egyptian General \n\nPetroleum Corporation (EGPC) have equity stakes, will construct, own and operate processing units to refine \n\natmospheric residue to be fed from EGPC's existing Cairo Refinery, and will then sell diesel and other refined \n\nproducts to EGPC over the long-term. JBIC is financing ERC to construct the new processing units, the EPC \n\ncontractor for which is a joint venture which includes Mitsui & Co., Ltd., thereby supporting the export of Japanese \n\nplant facilities and machinery.  \n\n \n\n3. With many of its existing refineries equipped with simple and outdated distillation units, Egypt, an exporter of surplus \n\nfuel oil, is unable to meet domestic demand for middle distillates such as diesel and relies on imports for such \n\nproducts. The Project is aimed at substituting such imports with domestic production by installing advanced \n\nprocessing facilities. Additionally, the Project is expected to contribute to environmental improvement, as the \n\nproduction of high-quality refined products with the state-of-the-art facilities to be installed will reduce emissions of \n\nsuch air pollutants as NOx and SOx. \n\n \n\n4. During the fourth meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in May 2008, the \n\ngovernment of Japan pledged to offer some 2.5 billion US dollars in financial support to Africa over a 5-year period \n\nthrough JBIC operations.  This loan, which supports Japanese firms' exports to Africa, is well aligned with this \n\ngovernment policy.   \n\n \n\n5. When the Project was forced to reconsider its financing plan due to the credit squeeze in the aftermath of the \n\nfinancial crisis in 2008, JBIC decided to participate in this Project and helped structure effective financing in \n\ncollaboration with other public financial institutions, while drawing on its abundant experience in project finance.  To \n\ncreate export opportunities for Japanese industries, JBIC will continue its support for Japanese overseas business \n\nactivities by drawing on its expertise, risk-assuming function and wide range of financial instruments. \n\n\n\nMay 6, 2010 IFC project# 29128: The project consists of the construction of a 5 million ton per annum hydro-cracking and coking facility in Mostorod, Greater Cairo, by the Egyptian Refining Company SAE (â€œERCâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€) to upgrade locally available refinery atmospheric residue into lighter products, such as ultra low sulfur Euro V diesel and high octane gasoline blending component, for the domestic Egyptian market (the â€œProjectâ€). The Project will also include environmental upgrades to the adjoining facilities of state-owned Cairo Oil Refining Company (â€œCORCâ€) and Petroleum Pipeline Company (â€œPPCâ€). \n\nEgyptian General Petroleum Company (â€œEGPCâ€), a Government of Egypt (â€œGOEâ€) economic authority, and owner of both CORC and PPC, will supply most of the feedstock to the Project and off-take most of its production. The Project is seen by GOE as an important import substitution project which will address the strong deficit of lighter petroleum products in the Greater Cairo region, which represents about half of the Egyptian refined products market, and Egyptâ€™s surplus of atmospheric residue/fuel oil.",

   "September 30, 2010 \n\n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on September \n\n29 (U.S.time) a loan agreement in the aggregate amount of up to 750 million US dollars with MT Falcon Holdings \n\nCompany, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (MT Falcon), a Mexican firm where Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (â€œMitsuiâ€) and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. \n\n(â€œTGCâ€) have equity stakes to finance the acquisition of a portfolio of power assets in Mexico.  The loan, provided in \n\nproject financing,*2 was cofinanced with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and \n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, with JBIC providing political risk guarantee for the portion financed by these \n\nprivate financial institutions. \n\n \n\n2. The purpose of the loan is to provide financial support for the acquisition of a portfolio of power assets owned by a \n\nSpanish company, Gas Natural, and their long term operation and maintenance by MT Falcon.  The target assets \n\nconsists of five independent power producers (IPPs)*3 owning five power stations (combined total power generation \n\ncapacity: 2,233 MW) located in northeastern Mexico, a gas pipeline company, and another associated company. \n\nThis is portfolio-oriented project financing to be repaid by revenues of the multi-IPPs generated by selling electricity \n\nto the off-taker, Federal Electricity Commission (ComisiÃ³n Federal de Electricidad (CFE)), a state-owned power \n\ncompany in Mexico.  \n\n \n\n3. In Mexico, President Felipe CalderÃ³n launched the National Infrastructure Program*4 in 2007, which focuses on \n\ninvestments in infrastructure projects.  In the power sector, the Program set out an expansion of power generation \n\ncapacity of 9,000 MW by 2012.  It is thus expected that new IPP-style power generation projects will be planned in \n\nthe coming years. \n\n \n\n4. Given this circumstance, it is expected that supporting the acquisition of power assets by Mitsui and TGC with this \n\nloan and guarantee will encourage Japanese firms to increase their presence in Mexico's power market, and that \n\nthis loan and guarantee will help Japanese firms promote their participation in infrastructure projects, including \n\npower generation projects and the acquisition of interests in IPP projects. \n\n \n\n5. JBIC will support overseas infrastructure projects undertaken by Japanese firms by performing its function, \n\nemploying a range of facilities and schematic arrangements.",

This is a partnership between Abu Dhabi's national oil company and Japan's development bank.  \n\n \n\nAbu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and loan agreement valued up to US $3 billion dollars in Abu Dhabi on November 2, 2010.\n\n\n\nH.E. Yousef Omair bin Yousef, Secretary General of the Supreme Petroleum Council and ADNOC CEO, and Mr. Hiroshi Watanabe, JBIC President and CEO, conducted the signing at a ceremony in the presence of Mr. \n\nYoshikatsu Nakayama, Japanâ€™s Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry that took place at the Shaikh Khalifa Energy Complex. \n\n\n\nThe signed MOU aims to further strengthen the comprehensive and strategic partnership already established between ADNOC and JBIC in a previous MOU signed in April 2007.\n\n\n\nThe objective is to mutually recognize the granting of new concessions to Japanese entities and to renew existing concessions involving Japanese entities, which are important goals within JBIC's mandate and thereby further strengthen a comprehensive and strategic partnership between JBIC and ADNOC. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, the US $3 billion loan agreement was co-financed with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (lead arranger), Mizuho Corporate Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, BNP Paribas, Tokyo Branch and Citibank Japan. \n\n\n\nADNOC, a Government of Abu Dhabi state-run and owned company, conducts oil and gas business in the Emirate \n\nof Abu Dhabi and owns most of the oil and gas reserves and production facilities in UAE.  \n\n\n\nThe UAE is an important country for Japanâ€™s resource strategy since it has been a stable source of crude oil to Japan for more than 30 years.  The UAE is one of the few countries that allows foreign oil companies to participate in the upstream segment based on concession agreements. Further strengthening the relationship with ADNOC will support the grant of new concessions and renewal of existing ones involving Japanese entities, therefore contributing to a stable \n\nsupply of energy resources to Japan.  \n\n\n\nJapanâ€™s Basic Energy Plan, revised in June this year, recognized â€œstrengthening bilateral ties with the countries endowed with natural resourcesâ€ as a concrete effort to secure a stable supply of oil resources.  The signing of this MOU and loan agreement are aligned with the Japanese government energy policy.  \n\n\n\nIt will strengthen bilateral ties between Japan and the resource-endowed country, which is strategically important to Japan.",

   "1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed today a loan \n\nagreement totaling up to 700 million US dollars with Mitsui E&P USA LLC (MEPUSA), a subsidiary established by \n\nMitsui & Co., Ltd. (\"Mitsui\") and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., (\"MOECO\"). \n\n \n\n2. The loan will finance MEPUSA acquiring a 15.5% interest in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania from \n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation and for participating in its development. This is the first loan JBIC has provided for \n\na shale gas project. \n\n \n\n3. Shale gas is a natural gas contained in shale, and is one of main types of unconventional natural gas.  Previously, \n\nits production was marginal and commercialization was considered difficult.  However, technological advances, such \n\nas horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have made low-cost production possible and its development has been \n\nrapid, especially in the United States.  In fact, more than 10% of US natural gas supply is now estimated to come \n\nfrom shale gas, with oil majors and newly participating firms vigorously engaging in the shale gas business in the \n\nUnited States.  \n\n \n\n4. For Mitsui and MOECO, the acquisition of interests through MEPUSA in the US natural gas market, a huge and \n\nflexible market, will diversify their supply portfolio and strengthen their corporate ability to balance demand and \n\nsupply.  In addition, developing unconventional gas in the U.S. will help relieve the tight Asian LNG market and \n\ncontribute to developing a more stable market, which is beneficial for Japanese LNG buyers. As there are vast \n\nproven reserves of shale gas around the world, by acquiring knowledge and experience in shale gas development, \n\nJapanese firms are expected to have future opportunities to participate in shale gas development projects in Asia \n\nand other regions.  \n\n \n\n5. This loan will support the acquisition of interests in shale gas, which has become a major new source of natural gas \n\nin recent years, thereby contributing to securing energy resources and their stable supply to Japan.

(Tokyo Gas) incorporated in the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\n \n\nThis is one of the worldÕs largest-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, with six participating parties: Tokyo Gas (through TGG), Chevron Corporation (Chevron), Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd., and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. The parties plan to develop large-scale gas fields including Gorgon and Jansz off the northwest coast of the state of Western Australia, and transport gas through an undersea pipeline to a liquefaction plant to be constructed on Barrow Island located in the same state. The plant is expected to produce and sell 15 million tons of LNG annually from the year 2014.\n\n \n\nThe loan will finance TGG for acquiring 1.0% interest of the Project from Chevron and for participating in its development.

In addition, Tokyo Gas will also have right to take delivery of about 150 thousand tons of LNG volume commensurate with its participating interest.\n\n \n\nThe global demand and supply balance of LNG is projected to become tighter over the medium and long term due to increasing demand in emerging market countries and heightened environmental awareness. Given the prospect of a significantly declining supply of LNG from Indonesia, JapanÕs largest LNG supply source, as well as many other long-term purchase contracts nearing renewal, Australia, a country endowed with abundant gas reserves and boasting political and economic stability, has come to play an increasingly significant role as an LNG supply source. In this context, the Project greatly contributes to securing a stable LNG supply for Japan.\n\n \n\nThis loan will support Japanese gas utilityÕs participation in this energy resource development project in Australia, one of JapanÕs most important energy resource supply sources, and in securing a stable supply of LNG.

   "NR/2011-4\n\nApril 1, 2011\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on March 31 a loan agreement with ICICI Bank Limited (ICICI) in India. The loan is a bank-to-bank loan to finance the export of thermal power generation boiler/steam turbine sets to India.\n\n\n\n¥ In this project, two joint venture companies*2 established primarily by Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T), one of the largest construction and heavy machinery manufacturing companies in India, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), fabricate supercritical pressure boiler/turbine sets (manufactured by MHI and exported by Marubeni Corporation) and sell them to Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (JPVL),*3 an Indian corporation constructing and operating a supercritical pressure coal-fired thermal power plant in Nigrie in the state of Madhya Pradesh. JBICÕs export financing, which reached the aggregate amount of 15.3 billion yen, was co-financed with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd(lead arranger). This will finance, by way of ICICI, JPVLÕs purchase of  boilers and steam turbine/generators.\n\n¥ The sustained fast-paced growth in the Indian economy in recent years has increased power demand. The Indian power supply, however, lags behind demand growth, causing chronic power shortages. Eliminating this bottleneck in power generation infrastructure is an urgent issue for businesses including Japanese affiliates and subsidiaries operating in the Indian market. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan drawn up by the Indian government intends to greatly expand capacity in the power sector. There are particularly growing expectations for supercritical pressure coal-fired thermal power generation, which can both supply stable power by making use of the countryÕs abundant coal resources and decrease burdens on the environment.\n\n¥ Under these circumstances, many Japanese firms, not to mention MHI, have entered the Indian power market by using their advanced technologies. This loan supports these Japanese firmsÕ efforts to capture overseas infrastructure business opportunities.\n\n \n\nICICI is the second largest private-sector bank in India, with extensive business transactions with a number of the countryÕs leading firms, and is involved in many domestic infrastructure projects. To date, JBIC and ICICI have developed close cooperative ties through the funding of supporting industries dealing with Japanese affiliates and subsidiaries operating in India; the progress in CDM projects; and trade financing to uphold trade amid the global financial crisis. Collaboration with a domestic Indian bank enabled by this loan is expected to further advance effective cooperation between Japanese firms entering India and local businesses, and serve to identify and formulate promising projects from earlier stages.\n\n \n\nJBIC is committed to continue steady support for Japanese business development in as well as exports to IndiaÕs fast growing markets.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 L&T-MHI Boilers Private Limited (LTMB) and L&T-MHI Turbine Generators Private Limited (LTMT) were both incorporated in India. JBIC provided loans for their manufacture of production facilities in July 2009.

   "April 1, 2011\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on March 31 an untied loan agreement with ICICI Bank Limited (ICICI) in India. This loan was made to ICICI Bank to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency and other environment-related projects in India. This is the first loan provided in the Asian region for GREEN operations.*2 The loan, totaling 200 million U.S. dollars, was co-financed with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) (lead arranger).\n\n \n\nThe Government of India set a numerical target of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20Ð25% from the 2005 level by 2020 and is accelerating efforts to achieve the targets set in each core national mission, including National Solar Mission,*3 under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, a medium-and-long-term road map detailing how India plans to move forward in combating climate change. Against this background, this loan will help India combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and advance the Indian governmentÕs environmental policy, while providing, as a result of fair business competition, opportunities for advanced Japanese technologies to contribute in these regards..\n\n \n\nICICI is the second largest private-sector bank in India, with extensive business transactions with many of the countryÕs leading firms, and is involved in many domestic infrastructure projects. To date, JBIC and ICICI have developed close cooperative ties through the funding of supporting industries dealing with Japanese affiliates and subsidiaries operating in India; the progress in CDM projects; and trade financing to uphold trade amid the global financial crisis. Collaboration with a domestic Indian bank enabled by this loan is expected to help identify and formulate promising projects from earlier stages.\n\n \n\nJBIC will help efforts to preserve the global environment by diffusing advanced technologies.\n\n\n\nSee p.96 of JBIC Annual Report 2012.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 See Information on April 27, 2010.\n\n*3 The national plan to produce 20 gigawatts of power domestically with solar energy by 2020.",

(SAPCO) incorporated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to finance the Shuweihat S3 Natural Gas-Fired Combined Thermal Power Generation Project. The loan was co-financed with financial institutions, including Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM). This is the fourth project finance loan for an infrastructure project in the UAE.*3\n\n \n\nIn this Project, SAPCO, a company jointly established by Sumitomo Corporation, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority, will construct a natural gas-fired combined thermal power plant (capacity: 1,600 MW) in Shuweihat, 250 km southwest of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the UAE. This is based on a BOO scheme*4 with SAPCO selling electricity to Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company for 25 years.\n\n \n\nAgainst the backdrop of fast economic growth in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which accounts for 60% of economic activity and 30% of the population of the UAE, its demand for electric power is projected to grow by more than 16% every year until 2015. The project, which will generate about 12% of the total power supply in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi upon its completion in 2014, is expected to fulfill a significant role as a supply source of power in the Emirate.\n\n \n\nGiven the prospect of continued tight natural resource supplies over the medium and long term, it is increasingly important for Japan to strengthen ties with resource-endowed countries. This loan will support urgently needed infrastructure development in the UAE, which accounts for 21% of JapanÕs total crude oil imports. At the same time, by supporting a Japanese firmÕs IPP project,*5 it will increase JapanÕs presence in this country and contribute to strengthening multilayered economic relations that go beyond those bound by natural resource trade.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to help develop closer economic relations between Japan and the UAE while, as an official financial institution, supporting Japanese industriesÕ overseas business development by performing its functions including project structuring and performing a risk-taking function.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 Project finance is a financing scheme that relies mainly on cash flows generated by the project for repayment.\n\n*3 To date, JBIC has extended loans in project financing to the Taweelah B Power and Desalination Project (the loan agreement signed in April 2005), the Fujairah F2 Power and Desalination Project (the loan agreement signed in December 2007) and the Shuweihat S2 Natural Gas-Fired Combined Thermal Power and Water Desalination Project (the loan agreement signed in October 2009).\n\n*4 BOO is a scheme in which a private company builds, operates and owns a project facility such as a power plant during the contract period.\n\n*5 An independent power producer (IPP) builds and operates a power generation facility on its own and sells the electricity generated from it.",

The loan was co-financed with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited. \n\n \n\nThe direct loan will finance SCR for the acquisition of an additional 51% interest in the Minerva coal mine, located in the vicinity of Emerald, Queensland, from Felix Resources Limited, an Australian company. With this additional 51% interest, SCR is to own a 96% stake in this mine. This credit was structured as a security package assuring the creditworthiness of SCR based on cash flows from coal mines SCR possesses and the collateral of some coal mine interests, mainly Minerva coal mine. With the acquisition of an additional interest, SCR is to conduct mining operations as an operator and conduct sales activities for the coal produced there.\n\n \n\nAbout one half of the thermal coal produced in the mine is sold to Japanese power utilities and cement manufacturers based on long-term contracts through Sojitz Corporation, which is engaged in marketing in Japan. The coal produced by the Minerva coal mine has a quality required for power generating facilities of Japanese end-users. In addition, the coal is shipped from the Port of Gladstone, a port that has relatively short demurrage, thus reducing the risk of delayed delivery. Another advantage is that it will help the end-users avoid the concentration of supply source in a major supplier with diversification of supply sources.\n\n \n\nThe loan is intended to support a project by a Japanese firm for selling coal to Japanese utilities and industry in general by acquiring an interest in an overseas coal mine and conducting its operations as an operator. It will thereby contribute to securing energy resources and the stable supply of these resources to Japan. JBIC is committed to supporting the development and acquisition of strategically important natural resources through project formulation that utilizes its range of financial instruments and schemes, as well as its risk-assuming function.",

(MODEC), Mitsui & Co.,Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation have equity stakes. The loan, provided as project financing,*2  will support a project in which a long-term FPSO*3  system chartering service_will be offered by GUARA MV 23 B.V. to Guara B.V., a consortium which has a concession in the Guara area (Guara oil field)*4 and was formed in the Netherlands by Petr—leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), a state-owned oil company in Brazil, and others.*5  The loan is co-financed with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (co-lead arranger), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) (co-lead arranger), Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., ING Bank N.V. and SociŽtŽ GŽnŽrale. \n\n \n\nIn this project, MODEC will build an ultra-deep FPSO unit capable of operating 2,000 to 3,000 meters underwater and with the capacity to produce up to 120,000 barrels of crude oil and 180 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and store 1,600,000 barrels of crude oil. It will be chartered by Guara B.V. (leasing plus operation and maintenance) for 20 years. The FPSO vessel will be deployed for developing the Guara oil field.\n\n \n\nAs oil companies in a number of countries have been actively developing offshore oil fields in recent years, they foresee an increasing need for new FPSO systems, primarily in Latin America (namely Brazil) and the Western African region. In particular, a series of world-class oil and gas reserve discoveries beneath the geological formation of presalt layers of Brazilian offshore waters have attracted worldwide attention on huge deposits consisting mainly of medium-gravity and light oil.\n\n \n\nAs Japan's only operator of FPSO systems, MODEC faces intense competition against other major FPSO operators in the world. Nonetheless, MODEC expects to win business in FPSO projects with Petrobras by strengthening business relations through an FPSO charter service as Petrobras plans for the full-scale development and production of presalt oil and gas fields. This is the second presalt FPSO chartering project following a similar project in the TUPI oil field.*6\n\n \n\nThe Basic Act on Ocean Policy, which came into force in July 2007, and the Ocean Energy and Mineral Resource Development Plan, prepared at a meeting of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy (headed by the Prime Minister) in March 2009 based on the cabinet decision on the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy in March 2008 stipulates: ÒJapan should aim to develop methane hydrate and submarine hydrothermal fields in waters around Japan on a commercial basis in 10 years (by 2019).Ó In this project, Japanese underwater energy resource development companies provide an FPSO charter service, which is an indispensable component for offshore resource development. Therefore, this loan will lead to the strengthening the international competitiveness of Japanese firms in offshore resource development by helping them acquire and improve technologies, management practices and knowhow regarding the operation of ultra-deepwater FPSO systems, thereby indirectly contributing to the securing of access to resources and their stable supply to Japan in the future.\n\n \n\nUnder the Basic Act on Ocean Policy and the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, JBIC is committed to supporting the development and acquisition of strategically important resources to Japan as well as the maintenance and improvement of the international competitiveness of Japanese marine industries.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC;Governor : Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 Project finance is a financing scheme whereby the repayment of a loan extended to a project relies on cash flows generated by the operation of the project, with collateral limited to project goods and other assets.\n\n*3 A floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) system is a floating vessel for the first stage processing of crude oil produced at the oil well, which separates associated gas and water, and for the storage and offloading of oil.\n\n*4 The Guara field, located 310 kilometers off Rio de Janeiro, lies below an underwater presalt (rock salt) layer in the Santos Basin.

(PDVSA). Under these agreements, both companies obtained a right to offtake crude oil and petroleum products for 15 years. The loans are co-financed with an eight-bank syndicate of _he Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (lead arranger of a loan to the ITOCHU subsidiary), Mizuho Corporate Bank (lead arranger of a loan to the MC subsidiary), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. and Tokyo branches of BNP Paribas Bank, CrŽdit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank and SociŽtŽ GŽnŽrale. The aggregate amount of each loan provided in the co-financing amounted to 675 million US dollars, with a combined overall total of both loans reaching 1,350 million US dollars. The co-financed portion by these private banks is covered by Investment and Loan Insurance for Natural Resources and Energy provided by Incorporated Administrative Agency, Nippon Export and Insurance (NEXI).\n\n \n\nBased on the above framework agreements, each of ITOCHU and MC will be able to offtake crude oil and petroleum products from PDVSA for 15 years, which is expected to help diversify supply sources of crude oil and petroleum products to Japan.\n\n \n\nVenezuela is currently the world's 10th largest crude oil producer, and if extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt is added, the country is endowed with oil reserves comparable to those in Saudi Arabia. According to a medium- and long-term strategic plan unveiled in 2010, PDVSA plans to increase the current production of 3 million barrels of crude oil per day to 4.48 million barrels per day by 2015 and double natural gas production. It is therefore preparing itself for a host of large-scale investment projects.  \n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to strengthen ties with resource companies in oil-producing countries and intends to support the securing of energy resources to Japan and the creation and expansion of business opportunities for Japanese firms in the oil and gas sector, while mitigating country risk with its capacity as an official financial institution.",

The loan was cofinanced with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC).\n\n \n\nThe loan will finance the procurement of steam turbines and related equipment as a whole from Toshiba Corporation and Sojitz Corporation, as PVN will construct a coal-fired power plant (600 MW _ 2 units) in Ha Tinh Province located in the central region of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\n \n\nJBIC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with PVN in June 2010 on operational cooperation.*2  Since then, both parties have been engaging in concrete discussions on the possibility of JBICÕs cooperation for projects in the infrastructure sector, including power generating projects undertaken by PVN.  These discussions have led to the signing of this loan agreement.  This is the first loan JBIC has extended to PVN for its project.\n\n \n\nIn Vietnam, demand for electricity has been increasing sharply against the backdrop of robust economic growth.  However, the construction of power plants has lagged behind increasing demand, which has resulted in tight power supply.  To address this situation, the Vietnamese government placed national priority on the expansion of power supply capacity in the 7th National Power Development Master Plan.  And under this Master Plan, it has been pushing forward the construction of power plants that make effective use of the countryÕs own resources.  To achieve goals in this Master Plan, PVN, a major state-owned corporate group, has been constructing multiple power plants, including this project.

In addition, Tokyo Gas has concluded a long-term sales and purchase agreement with BG Group to take an annual delivery of 1.2 million-ton LNG, which is equivalent to more than 10% of the companyÕs annual offtake volume, over two decades from 2015. This sales and purchase agreement sets forth that the LNG is to be supplied from multiple sources in BG GroupÕs LNG portfolio including this project, providing a stable and flexible supply of LNG to the company.  \n\n \n\nAustralia occupies an extremely significant position in terms of supplying natural gas to Japan. CBM reserves stored in coal beds are believed to account for approximately 40% of the total proven natural gas reserves in Australia. In Queensland, where a large portion of the countryÕs CBM is located, a number of projects are ongoing, including this project, to liquefy CBM into LNG for export. By supporting the Japanese firmÕs participation in the CBM-LNG project, JBICÕs loan will also help it accumulate know-how and experience of Japanese firms in CMB development.  \n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to contribute to JapanÕs energy security by actively supporting the acquiring of interest in crude oil and natural gas by Japanese firms.",

The loan is thus expected to contribute to promoting the adoption of renewable energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in Mexico. The Mexican government has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. It also served as chair of COP16 held in 2010, thereby helping reach its accord. In addition, Mexico has set a quantitative goal of reducing GHG emissions by 50 percent by 2050 from the base year of 2000, and its government is taking vigorous steps to implement measures to cope with climate change in its efforts to achieve this goal through greater harnessing of renewable energy.\n\n\n\nBANCOMEXT is an official financial institution in Mexico with a mission to promote external trade and implement the national development plan. In recent years, it has been strengthening support for environmental conservation measures taken by the private sector and environmental projects. Since the 1980s, JBIC has built a close relationship with BANCOMEXT by providing loans for exports of machinery and equipment to Mexico as well as for the country's industrial investments and export promotion. This loan, which finances the environment sector, will lead to even closer mutual cooperative ties between the two institutions.\n\n\n\nJBIC is committed to global environmental sustainability in cooperation with official financial institutions in other countries in order to contribute to the sound development of the Japanese and international economies\n\n\n\n\n\n(See also p.96 of JBIC Annual Report 2012)\n\n\n\n.",

(GNS), a subsidiary of Electric Power Development Co, Ltd. (J-Power), for the Nong Saeng Natural Gas-Fired Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. The loan is cofinanced with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Mizuho Corporate Bank., Ltd., The Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited and KASIKORNBANK Public Company Limited.\n\n \n\nIn this Project, GNS will build and operate a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant with the capacity of 1,600 MW (800 MW _ 2) in Nong Saeng district, Saraburi Province, with the electricity generated to be sold to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) for 25 years.\n\n \n\nAccording to the power development plan of the Thai government, the country's demand for electricity is projected to grow by an annual average of 4.19% by 2030. To meet such increasing demand, the Thai authorities have formulated a plan to increase the national capacity of power generation from 31,349 MW in 2010 to 65,547 MW by 2030. This project holds an important place in this plan.\n\n \n\nThe project is a typical form of Japanese overseas integrated infrastructure system deployment project, with J-Power leading the project development, operation and maintenance of the most advanced-type power-generating systems using Japanese technologies. It is also a significant project for many Japanese firms' subsidiaries and affiliates operating in Thailand, from the point of view of ensuring a stable supply of electricity. As such, the Project will not only contribute broadly to infrastructure development in Thailand, but it will also contribute to overseas economic activities of Japanese firms.\n\n \n\nJBIC launched the Enhanced Facility for Global Cooperation in Low Carbon Infrastructure and Equity Investment (E-FACE) last April.*2  At that time, JBIC announced its policy to strengthen support for overseas integrated infrastructure system deployment and other strategic projects undertaken by Japanese firms, while vigorously mobilizing Japanese private-sector funding for these purposes. JBIC is supporting this Project as part of its efforts under E-FACE.\n\n \n\nAs Thailand and Asian countries have continued robust economic growth, they foresee growing needs for developing and improving infrastructure. This has presented a major business opportunity in infrastructure development to Japanese companies. Amid these developments, JBIC will support overseas infrastructure business activities of Japanese firms through project structuring risk taking, by drawing on its range of financial instruments and schemes and, through these operations, will contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 See Press Release on April 1, 2011.",

(KEW), an Australian subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. (Kyushu Electric Power). The loan is cofinanced with private financial institutions. \n\n \n\nThis loan will finance the project where Kyushu Electric Power joins through KEW with Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and other sponsors for the project that transports the natural gas produced in the Wheatstone Iago Field and nearby fields, located northwest off Western Australia, to Ashburton North, Western Australia and produce a maximum of 8.9 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year.  \n\n \n\nThis loan will finance KEW for acquiring a 1.83% interest in the upstream (i.e., development of natural gas fields) and a 1.464% interest in liquefaction facilities from Chevron. Since this is the first interest acquisition of an LNG project for Kyushu Electric Power, it plans to take delivery of 830,000 tonsÑabout 20% of its annual LNG procurementÑa combined amount of offtake based on this interest acquisition deal (130,000 tons per year) and a long-term offtake contract (700,000 tons per year).  \n\n \n\nLNG supply and demand situation in the world is projected to get tighter over the medium and long term in view of expanding demand in emerging market countries and increasing awareness of the environment. In Japan, there has been growing expectations on a stable procurement of LNG in recent years. On the other hand, the supply from Indonesia, traditionally the main LNG supplier, is expected to decrease sharply in the coming years. Coincidentally, Japan is entering a period when a number of the long-term offtake contracts have to be renewed with other LNG supply countries.  Under these circumstances, there is growing importance of Australia as an LNG supplier, given its abundant reserves and stable political and economic conditions.  This project has thus an important implication from the point of view of Australia becoming a new LNG supply source to Japan and the securing of a stable supply of LNG.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to provide positive support for acquisition of interests in natural gas and crude oil by Japanese business firms, thereby contributing to Japan's energy security.",

The loan is cofinanced with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC; lead arranger) and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., with JBIC providing a guarantee for their cofinanced portion. \n\n \n\nThe loan is extended under GREEN operations*2 to finance environment-related loans focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in India, and is thus expected to contribute to the promotion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. This follows up the similar JBIC loan*3 signed in March 2011 with ICICI Bank in support of its financing of environment-related projects. \n\n \n\nThe government of India has pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 20~25% per unit of GDP below its 2005 level by the year 2020. Further, under the medium and long-term environment policy, National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), the government is carrying out a variety of activities. Under these circumstances, JBIC's loan is expected not only to help reduce GHG emission in India, but also to promote the Indian government's environmental policy. It will also contribute to providing opportunities for disseminating Japan's internationally acclaimed advanced environmental technology across India.  \n\n \n\nTo this day, JBIC and ICICI Bank have built up close cooperation ties through loan commitments that were designed to support: the development of the local supporting industry, which is significant for the Japanese firms operating business in India as well; trade finance during the financial crisis; renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and export of thermal power plant facilities. By supporting the environmental sector, the latest loan will further strengthen relations between the two institutions. \n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to support, in cooperation with local financial institutions, global environmental sustainability by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming functions. \n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC; Governor: Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 See Information dated April 27, 2010.\n\n*3 See Press Release dated April 1, 2011",

The loan, co-financed with a private financial institution, is extended to promote a project for securing and developing energy and natural resources.  \n\n \n\nThis loan will finance MKCI to develop a new mining block in the Kestrel Mine, located south of the Bowen Basin in Queensland, Australia. The quality of coal produced by the Kestrel Mine is rated highly by Japanese blast furnace steelmakers for having good property as coking material. While the existing mining blocks currently produce about 4 million tons of coal per year, the production from these blocks will be coming to an end in 2014. Developing a new mining block is projected to produce about 6.5 million tons of coal per year at its peak.\n\n \n\nThe amount of coking coal reserves is limited on the global level, even if it is an essential raw material for making steel. Thus, it is a challenge to secure its necessary amount at appropriate prices. The coking coal produced in the present mining block has been sold mainly to blast furnace steelmakers and coke manufacturers primarily in Japan, as well as Asia and Europe. It is expected that coal products from the new mining block will continue to be sold to Japanese enterprises. The project thus has significant implication for securing stable procurement of coking coal for Japan.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to provide positive support for the development and acquisition of raw materials by Japanese business firms.",

(Osaka Gas) in the Commonwealth of Australia. The loan, provided in project financing,*2 is cofinanced with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (lead arranger). The overall cofinancing amounts to 302 million U.S. dollars.\n\n \n\nThis is one of the world's largest-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects where Osaka Gas (through OGG) and 5 other companies comprising Chevron Corporation (Chevron), Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. jointly develop Gorgon, Jansz and other large-scale gas fields off the northwest coast of the state of Western Australia and transport gas through an undersea pipeline to a liquefaction plant on Barrow Island located in the same state. The plant is expected to produce and sell up to 15 million tons of LNG annually from the year 2014.\n\n \n\nThis loan will finance OGG for developing this Project. The aggregate of the amount of LNG which Osaka Gas takes from Chevron (1,375 thousand tons per year) and the amount which OGG has the right to take delivery of corresponding to OGG's interest in this Project (187.5 thousand tons per year), totaling 1,562.5 thousand tons, is equivalent to about 20% of the LNG purchased annually by Osaka Gas.\n\n \n\nThe global demand of LNG is projected to increase due to growing demand in emerging market countries and heightened environmental awareness. In Japan, there have been increasing hopes for a stable supply of LNG in recent years. However, LNG supply from Indonesia, Japan's major LNG supply source, is expected to decrease significantly, and the renewal time is approaching for a number of long term purchase contracts with other countries. This prospect has made Australia, with its abundant gas reserves and political and economic stability, increasingly important as a supply source of LNG. In this context, supporting Japanese companies for developing energy resources in this project has a significant implication for securing a stable LNG supply to Japan.\n\n \n\nThis loan will support a Japanese gas company's participation in an energy resource development project in Australia, one of Japan's most important energy resource supply sources, and its stable purchase of LNG.

The total cofinancing amount is 1,125 million U.S. dollars.\n\n \n\nIn this project, MODEC will build an ultra-deep FPSO unit capable of operating 2,000 to 3,000 meters underwater and with the capacity to produce up to 150,000 barrels of crude oil and 280 million cubic feet of gas per day, and store 1,600,000 barrels of crude oil. Cernambi Sul MV24 B.V. and a joint venture which will be established mainly by an affiliated company of MODEC in Brazil will provide charter services (leasing and operation and maintenance services) to Tupi B. V. for 20 years. The FPSO vessel will be deployed for developing the Cernambi South area.\n\n \n\nAs oil companies in a number of countries have been actively developing offshore oil fields in recent years, they foresee an increasing need for new FPSO systems, primarily in Latin America (namely Brazil) and the Western African region. In particular, a series of world-class oil and gas reserve discoveries beneath the geological formation of pre-salt layers of Brazilian offshore waters have attracted worldwide attention to huge deposits consisting mainly of medium-gravity and light oil. This is the 3rd FPSO Operation Project for an oil field of pre-salt layers, following Lula field (former Tupi field)*6  and Guara field*7. \n\n \n\nThe Basic Act on Ocean Policy, which came into force in July 2007, and the Ocean Energy and Mineral Resource Development Plan, prepared at a meeting of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy (headed by the Prime Minister) in March 2009 based on the cabinet decision on the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy in March 2008, stipulates: \"Japan should aim to develop methane hydrate and submarine hydrothermal fields in waters around Japan on a commercial basis in 10 years (by 2019).\" In this project, Japanese underwater energy resource development companies provide an FPSO charter service in the growing degree of difficulty in the development of deeper offshore fields, which is an indispensable component for offshore resource development. Therefore, this loan will lead to the strengthening the international competitiveness of Japanese firms in offshore resource development by helping them acquire and improve technologies, management practices, and knowhow regarding the operation of ultra-deepwater FPSO systems, thereby indirectly contributing to the securing of access to resources and their stable supply to Japan in the future.\n\n \n\nUnder the Basic Act on Ocean Policy and the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, JBIC is committed to supporting the development and acquisition of strategically important resources to Japan, as well as the maintenance and improvement of the international competitiveness of Japanese marine industries.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 JBIC is the international wing of the Japan Finance Corporation (JFC;Governor : Shosaku Yasui).\n\n*2 Project finance is a financing scheme whereby the repayment of a loan extended to a project relies on cash flows generated by the operation of the project, with collateral limited to project goods and other assets.\n\n*3 A floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) system is a floating vessel for the first stage processing of crude oil produced at the oil well, which separates associated gas and water, and for the storage and offloading of oil.\n\n*4 The Cernambi South area of a pre-salt oil field, a giant oil field located 300 kilometeres off the south coast of Rio de Janeiro, lies below an underwater pre-salt (rock salt) layer in the Santos Basin.\n\n*5 The consortium constitutes Petrobras, BG Group, and Galp Energia in Portugal, all of which hold groups of companies.\n\n*6 See News Release on March 31,2010.\n\n*7 See News Release on June 29,2011.",

This Project will meet about 10% of the country's demand for electric power in 2014 when it is planned to be completed, and the plant is expected to perform a substantial role as the country's electricity supply source.  \n\n \n\nJBIC's support for the export of the machinery and the equipment for the power station by Japanese firms in this Project contributes to create business opportunities for them in Morocco where demand for electricity is expected to increase in the years to come. Thus, it will serve to maintain and improve the international competitiveness of Japanese industries. Another point worth noting is that this is a power generation project in a third country being undertaken by the Abu Dhabi government through TAQA. As Abu Dhabi is a very important energy resource supplier to Japan, this loan will contribute to further strengthening multi-layered economic relations between Japan and Abu Dhabi.\n\n \n\nThe Government of Japan pledged in its statement during the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) held in May 2008 that JBIC would provide financial support totaling up to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Africa over a 5Ðyear period. This loan will serve toward this pledge. JBIC will continue to support overseas infrastructure deployment by Japanese firms by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing risk-assuming functions.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 A buyer's credit is direct loan to a foreign importer (buyer) to finance the import of machinery and equipment or the utilization of Japanese technical services from Japanese firms.\n\n*2 JBIC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on comprehensive strategic partnership with the Government of Morocco in March 2011 to enhance economic relationship in view of a potentially large business opportunity in the country. See Press Release on March 8, 2011.\n\n*3 Project finance is a financing scheme in which repayments are made solely from cash flows generated by the project and secured only on the project assets.",

The loan will be cofinanced by private financial institutions. The overall cofinancing amounts to the equivalent of 50 million U.S. dollars. This will be the first credit line to be offered by JBIC that specializes in supporting the export of renewable energy-related equipment.\n\n \n\nThis credit line is intended to provide medium and long-term U.S. dollar or yen-denominated credit, to finance through ICICI Bank, the purchase of renewable energy related equipment (including solar photovoltaic power, solar thermal energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy, etc.) from Japan, thereby supporting expansion of exports to India.\n\n \n\nAs demand for electric power has been increasing, driven by the recent burgeoning economic growth, the Indian government has been making efforts to promote a broader utilization of renewable energy for power generation. It has a plan to increase the power generation capacity of renewable energy to 41.4 GW by the year 2017. This credit line will support the export of renewable energy-related equipment by Japanese firms to India, thereby contributing to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.\n\n \n\nJBIC and ICICI Bank have built up close cooperative ties through loan commitments that are/were designed to support the following initiatives: the development of the local support industry which is significant for Japanese firms operating in India as well; trade finance during the financial crisis; renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and export of thermal power plant facilities to India. In partnership with such Indian domestic banks, JBIC is committed to continue to support the deployment of Japanese business activities to India, including those in the renewable energy sector, by drawing on its range of financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing risk-assuming functions. \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 ICICI Bank Limited (NYSE:IBN) is India's largest private sector bank and the second largest bank in the country, with consolidated total assets of 119 billion U.S. dollars at March 31, 2012.\n\n*2 An export credit line is a form of export credit in which JBIC makes a commitment of the maximum amount of credit to be extended to its client (foreign banks or other entities) to finance exports of machinery, equipment and services from Japan. This renewable energy-related export credit line has a feature of being able to offer the maximum repayment term for 18 years in accordance with the Sector Understanding on Export Credits of Renewable Energies and Water Projects under the OECD Arrangements on Officially Supported Export Credits.",

   "NR/2012-25\n\nJuly 20, 2012\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Hiroshi Okuda) signed a loan agreement today totaling up to 49 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion) with JGC Exploration Eagle Ford LLC (JEEF), a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of JGC Corporation (JGC). The loan, cofinanced with private financial institutions, is extended to finance a project for acquiring and developing energy and natural resources. The overall cofinancing amount to 70 million U.S. dollars. This is the first loan extended by JBIC to a shale oil project.\n\n \n\nThe loan will fund development and production of shale oil in the Eagle Ford shale oil fields in Texas, of which JGC has a 10% ownership through JEEF.\n\n \n\nShale oil is a crude oil contained in the formation of a sedimentary rock called shale, and, like shale gas, its deposits are found in a number of broad areas on the earth, including North America, Europe and Australia. In the United States, many shale oil development projects, including this project, are currently underway.  The operator of this project, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, has abundant experience as an operator in U.S. shale oil and gas production.\n\n \n\nThis loan will support participation in a shale oil development project by Japanese companies, given the prospect of a sharp rise in its production in the coming years. Since Japanese firms acquire knowhow on shale oil development through a project like this, it is considered to help increase their opportunities to participate in U.S. and other foreign shale oil projects going forward. As a result, it will lead to an increase in the independent development ratio through the firm's gaining ownership and it is expected to contribute to Japan's energy security in the future.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to vigorously support Japanese businesses for promoting development and acquisition of energy resources by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming function.",

(PE) (its shareholders are the Private Shareholders and Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC)) to acquire from PE up to 273 million U.S. dollars of preferred stocks that carry no voting right. Apart from this equity participation, JBIC also signed a loan agreement totaling up to about 1,927 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion) with PE Wheatstone Pty Ltd (PEW), where TEPCO and PE have equity stakes. The loan is cofinanced with private financial institutions.\n\n\n\nIn the Wheatstone LNG Project, PEW jointly undertakes with Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. (Kyushu Electric) and other sponsors, to transport the natural gas produced in the Wheatstone Field, Iago Field and nearby fields, located northwest off Western Australia, to Ashburton North, Western Australia, and to produce a maximum of 8.9 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG), etc. each year.\n\n\n\nThe equity participation and loan will finance PEW in acquiring a 10% interest in the upstream natural gas fields to participate in their development, and an 8% interest in liquefaction facilities from Chevron to produce LNG and associated products. Based on its acquired interest, PEW will lift about 700,000 tons of LNG per year, all of which will be purchased by TEPCO. Separately, TEPCO plans to take delivery of about 3.5 million tons of LNG per year based on long-term offtake contracts*1. Thus, combined with the amount commensurate with an interest of PEW in the Project, TEPCO will take delivery of a total of about 4.2 million tons of LNG per year. Apart from the equity participation and the loan, JBIC made a loan to a local subsidiary of Kyushu Electric to finance its participation in the Wheatstone LNG Project in November 2011. In this deal, Kyushu Electric will take delivery of about 830,000 tons of LNG per year from this Project*2. Thus the overall amount of LNG to be delivered to Japan, including the amounts delivered to TEPCO and Kyushu Electric, is expected to reach 7 million tons per year.\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, TEPCO, being bound by funding constraints, is unable to independently participate in this Project. Thus, JBIC has made an equity investment and provided a loan for part of the participation and development funds for this Project. Thereby, JBIC will contribute to strategically securing important energy resources in public-private partnerships, as well as a stable electric supply for Japan.\n\n\n\nGlobal LNG demand is projected to increase well into the future, due to increasing demand in emerging markets and to increasing awareness of the environment. This prospect has been growing expectations in Japan for a stable procurement of LNG in recent years. On the other hand, it is foreseen that the supplies from Southeast Asian countries, traditionally Japan's main LNG suppliers, will decrease in the coming years. Coincidentally, Japan is entering a period when a number of the long-term offtake contracts have to be renewed one after another with other LNG supply countries. Under these circumstances, Australia, with its abundant reserves and stable political and economic conditions, has become increasingly important as a new LNG supplier. Thus, this Project has a significant implication for securing a stable LNG supply source to Japan.\n\n\n\nJBIC will continue to support the development and acquisition of interests in natural gas and crude oil, etc. by Japanese firms, thereby contributing to Japan's energy security.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 This amount is about 20% of the annual LNG purchased by TEPCO under its long-term offtake contracts.\n\n*2 See Press Release on November 14, 2011.",

This is the first shale gas development and production project in which INPEX will participate. \n\n \n\nCanada is endowed with vast shale gas reserves and, given its geography, great potential as a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplier for the markets in the Asia-Pacific region. With these projects, the possibility of producing LNG from shale gas and exporting the product to Japan and East Asian countries is also currently under consideration. The fact that INPEX acquires natural gas interests in Canada through participation in these projects will help Japanese firms acquire knowhow on shale gas development and increase the ratio of energy resources independently developed by Japanese firms. Thus, it is expected to contribute to Japan's energy security.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese businesses that promote the acquisition of interests and development of energy resources such as natural gas by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects, and by performing its risk-assuming function.",

The credit line is cofinanced with private financial institutions*2, which brings the overall cofinancing amount to the equivalent of 100 million U.S. dollars. This is the first credit line offered by JBIC to Turkey that specializes in supporting the export of machinery and equipment in the field of renewable energy and other related sectors. \n\n \n\nUnder this agreement, an export credit line is set up for Isbank to finance Turkish local companies in the purchase of Japanese machinery and equipment in the field of renewable energy (including those for geothermal, windpower, biomass and solar (thermal and photovoltaic) power generation) and climate change mitigation (including those for thermal power plants equipped with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) facilities*3, hybrid power generation plants*4, cogeneration projects and regional air-conditioning-related facilities). This export credit line will provide medium- and long-term loans, either in yen or in U.S. dollars, to finance these exports through Isbank, thus providing financial support for expanding the export of Japanese machinery and equipment to Turkey.\n\n \n\nThe Turkish government has intensified efforts to propagate power generation harnessing renewable energy as part of its environmental policy and has set a target for the share of renewable energy to reach 30% of total energy consumption by 2023. Moreover, the Turkish government is making efforts to modernize and retrofit existing power stations, as they will help mitigate climate change. This credit line will support the export of machinery and equipment in the field of renewable energy and other innovative efforts to Turkey by Japanese companies, thereby contributing to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.  \n\n \n\nJBIC and Isbank have built close cooperative ties over the years with bank loans that supported the export of ships built in Japanese shipyards.

To meet such increasing demand, the Thai authorities have formulated a plan to increase the national capacity of power generation from 32,395 MW in 2011 to 70,686 MW by 2030, thus this Project holds an important place in this plan. Furthermore, in terms of ensuring a stable supply of electricity, this is a significant project for many Japanese subsidiaries and affiliates operating in Thailand, and it will contribute broadly to infrastructure development in Thailand as well as overseas economic activities of Japanese companies. \n\n \n\nThis project follows the Nong Saeng Natural Gas-Fired Combined Cycle Power Plant project*3 signed in November 2011. It is an overseas integrated infrastructure system development project, with J-POWER leading the project development, maintenance and operation of the most advanced-type, high-efficiency and low environmental load power-generating systems built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. JBIC supports this project as part of its efforts under the Enhanced Facility for Global Cooperation in Low Carbon Infrastructure and Equity Investment (E-FACE)*4. \n\n \n\nAs Thailand and Asian countries have continued robust economic growth, they foresee growing needs for developing and improving infrastructure. This has presented a major business opportunity in infrastructure development to Japanese companies. Amid these developments, JBIC will support the overseas infrastructure business activities of Japanese companies through project structuring and risk taking by drawing on its range of financial instruments and schemes, and contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Project finance is a financial scheme in which a loan is collateralized against the projectÕs future cash flow.\n\n*2 KASIKORNBANK Public Company Limited, Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited, Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited and Land and Houses Bank Public Company Limited are also participating in cofinancing for the project.\n\n*3 See Press Release on November 7, 2011.\n\n*4 See Press Release on April 1, 2011.",

This loan is cofinanced with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, which brings the overall cofinancing amount to 250 million U.S. dollars. \n\n \n\nThe loan is intended to provide finance for ADOC to renew the interest of the currently operating ADOC owned Mubarraz, Umm Al-Anbar and Neewat Al-Ghalan Oil Fields in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi of United Arab Emirates (UAE). ADOC has been producing crude oil in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi since 1973, with all the crude oil output being shipped to Japan. \n\n \n\nUAE is the second largest crude oil exporter for Japan, following Saudi Arabia, (accounting for about 23% of JapanÕs total crude oil imports in 2011). The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which produces most of the crude oil in UAE, is also one of the few cases among the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries that allow the entry of foreign-affiliated companies to operate on the basis of concession agreements. By supporting the renewal of the concession agreement, this loan is expected to contribute to securing a long-term and stable supply of crude oil independently developed by Japanese companies, and thus contributing to JapanÕs energy security. \n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese businesses and promote the development and acquisition of energy and mineral resources by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects, and by performing its risk-assuming function, thereby contributing to Japan's energy security.",

The loan, provided in project financing,*1 is cofinanced with private financial institutions and export credit agencies (ECAs) in other countries,*2 with the overall cofinancing amount reaching 16 billion U.S. dollars. Part of the cofinancing loans provided by private financial institutions is insured or guaranteed by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) or ECAs in other countries.*3 This is JBIC's largest loan (in U.S. dollars) for a single project.\n\n \n\nIn this Project, INPEX CORPORATION (INPEX), TOTAL S.A., a French company, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd., Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., TOHO GAS Co., Ltd. and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., all of which have indirect equity stakes in Ichthys LNG, will develop the Ichthys Gas and Condensate*4 Field off the northwest coast of Western Australia; transport the produced gas through subsea gas pipelines to the onshore liquefaction plant to be built in Darwin, Northern Territory; and produce and sell liquefied natural gas (LNG; annual production capacity: 8.4 million tons), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and condensate through Ichthys LNG. This loan is intended to finance the development of the gas and condensate field and production of LNG and other petroleum products in this project.\n\n \n\nThis is the first project for INPEX as a Japanese company to operate the complete process of the project: from development of the gas and condensate field to production of LNG and other petroleum products. INPEX and Japanese power and gas companies have approximately 70% interests in the project and are expected to take delivery of about 70% of LNG produced (about 5.67 million tons per year). The importance of efforts to undertake LNG projects led by Japanese companies is stated in the Japanese government's Strategy for Securing Natural Resources.*5\n\n \n\nThe global demand of LNG is projected to increase due to growing demand in emerging market countries and heightened environmental awareness. In Japan, there have been increasing hopes for a stable supply of LNG in recent years. However, LNG supply from Indonesia, Japan's major LNG supply source, is expected to decrease significantly, and the renewal time is approaching for a number of long-term purchase contracts with other countries. This prospect has made Australia, with its abundant gas reserves and political and economic stability, increasingly important as a supply source of LNG. In this context, supporting Japanese companies for developing energy resources in this project has a significant implication for securing a stable LNG supply to Japan.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese businesses that promote the development and acquisition of energy resources by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming functions.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Project finance is a financial scheme in which repayments are made solely from cash flows generated by the project and secured only on the project assets.\n\n*2 Financial institutions participating in cofinancing are 24 Japanese and international private banks, including the following 7 Japanese banks: Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Limited, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, Mizuho Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. and Shinsei Bank, Limited. The Export and Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) and Australia's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) will also participate in cofinancing in this project.\n\n*3 Part of the cofinancing loans provided by private financial institutions is guaranteed by KEXIM and insured by Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-sure), Atradius Dutch State Business N.V.

This export credit line will thus provide medium- and long-term loans to these companies, either in yen or in U.S. dollars, through Gazprombank. \n\n \n\nThis is the third export credit line extended by JBIC to Gazprombank since 2007.*3 This time, in addition to Russia, the target countries for the export credit line have been expanded to include Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, with all of which Japan is expected to further strengthen ties through trade and investment. Thereby, JBIC intends to support the expansion of exports by Japanese companies to these countries.\n\n \n\nSince the first export credit line was extended to Gazprombank in 2007, JBIC and Gazprombank have built close cooperative ties. JBIC will continue to support Japanese companies' expansion of business in Russia and its neighboring countries in collaboration with such foreign financial institutions, by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects, and performing its risk-assuming function. \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 An export credit line is a form of export credit in which JBIC makes a commitment of the maximum amount of credit to be extended to foreign banks or other entities to finance the export of machinery and equipment from Japan.\n\n*2 Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) will provide Buyer's Credit Insurance for the portion cofinanced by private financial institutions.\n\n*3 See Press Release on June 8, 2007 and Press Release on July 3, 2007.",

(the \"Company\") in which INPEX CORPORATION and others have equity stakes. The loan is cofinanced with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\n \n\nThe loan follows the two previous loans signed with the Company in October 2005 and March 2010.*1_It is intended to finance the development of the offshore Kashagan Oil Field (the \"Oil Field\") in the Kazakhstan-controlled area of the North Caspian Sea. The Oil Field is being developed by an international consortium formed by the Company, ENI (Italy), ExxonMobil (U.S.), KazMunaiGaz (Kazakhstan), Royal Dutch Shell (Britain and Netherlands), Total (France) and ConocoPhillips (U.S.).\n\n \n\nThe Oil Field, which is one of the world's large-scale oil fields, is drawing increased attention from the world as a new energy source located outside the Middle East. Since the Company acquired a participating interest in the Offshore North Caspian Sea Contract Area in September 1998, it has engaged in developing the Oil Field as a member of the aforementioned international consortium. The loan will serve to diversify energy supply sources for Japan, as it is highly dependent on the Middle East for crude oil. The Oil Field will begin crude oil production by the middle of 2013, and phased development is being planned thereafter.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese companies for developing and acquiring interests in natural resources, such as crude oil, thereby contributing to Japan's energy security.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 See Press Release on October 27, 2005 and Press Release on March 2, 2010.",

The loan is cofinanced with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, with the overall cofinancing amount totaling 1 billion U.S. dollars.\n\n \n\nThe loan is intended to finance INPEX Oil & Gas Australia Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of INPEX in Australia, for acquiring, from Australian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (Britain and Netherlands; Shell), a 17.5% participating interest in the block containing the Prelude and Concerto gas fields, located approximately 475km north-northeast of Broome, off the coast of Western Australia, and for producing natural gas and processing it into liquefied natural gas (LNG) by utilizing floating LNG (FLNG) technology.\n\n \n\nFLNG technology is a new gas development technology whereby natural gas from offshore gas field is processed into liquid and stored on a large vessel equipped with an LNG plant and directly offloaded to an LNG carrier for shipment. Compared to constructing a liquefaction plant onshore, it does not need to lay down gas pipelines  or develop the onshore area for installing conventional facilities including liquefaction plant. Therefore, it requires less initial investments and minimizes the environmental impact.  In addition, since an FLNG vessel can move to other offshore gas fields, it is promising way of developing small- and medium-scale offshore gas fields. Participating in the world's leading FLNG Project led by Shell will also serve INPEX to acquire knowhow on FLNG projects.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese businesses for developing and acquiring interests in energy and mineral resources by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming function, thereby contributing to Japan's energy security.",

(agent bank), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. and the above loan amount includes the cofinanced portion amounting to 0.9 billion U.S. dollars. The signing was made by JBIC and ADNOC in the presence of Minister Motegi, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and H.E Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, Director General of ADNOC in Abu Dhabi, UAE.\n\n \n\nADNOC, a Government of Abu Dhabi state owned company, conducts oil and gas businesses in Abu Dhabi, which produces most of the oil and gas in UAE.  This loan is intended to finance ADNOC to expand their oil and gas development, following loans*1 in December 2007 and November 2010 to secure a long-term and stable supply of crude oil to Japan.\n\n \n\nThe UAE is an important country for Japan's resource strategy, since it has been a stable source of crude oil to Japan for more than 30 years. In addition, the UAE is one of the few countries that allow the entry of foreign-affiliated oil companies to operate on the basis of concession agreements. Also, part of the crude oil produced in Abu Dhabi can be loaded without using ship transport through the Strait of Hormuz, as the result of the commissioning of the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline (Fujairah Oil Pipeline), which has increased its strategic importance. JBIC previously signed memorandum of understandings*2 to establish a comprehensive and strategic partnership with ADNOC in April 2007, November 2010 and December 2012, thereby supporting to further strengthening of the partnership with UAE and secure a stable supply of energy resources to Japan.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to actively support Japanese businesses that promote the development and acquisition of energy resources by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming functions.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 See Press Releases on December 18, 2007 and Press Releases on November 4, 2010.\n\n*2 See Press Releases on May 1, 2007, Press Releases on November 4, 2010, and Press Releases on December 11, 2012.",

The loan, provided in project financing,*1 is cofinanced with Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and Korea Finance Corporation, which brings the overall cofinancing amount to 1 billion U.S. dollars. Such cofinancing loans provided by the financial institutions besides JBIC are insured by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) and Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-sure). This loan is the first JBIC project financing for an electric power project in the South America region.\n\n \n\nIn this project, EECSA will build and operate a coal-fired power plant with a net capacity of 472MW (236 MW _ 2) in Mejillones, Antofagasta, Chile, with the electricity generated to be sold to the neighboring Sierra Gorda Copper Mine*2 and local major mining companies.\n\n \n\nThis power infrastructure project, in which MC is a participant, will be jointly developed with a subsidiary of AES Corporation, a U.S. company, from construction to operation throughout the project. This is the first power infrastructure project in Chile in which a Japanese company has participated in as an equity provider. Thus it is expected to be a model case for future infrastructure business in Chile by Japanese companies. \n\n \n\nThe power demand in ChileÕs northern electric power system (SING System) where this project is located is expected to grow by about 5.6% annually through to the year 2025, backed by a robust appetite for electricity consumption due to copper mine development, and it has become crucial to secure a stable supply of electricity for the development. Under these circumstances, through the provision of a stable supply of electricity to Sierra Gorda Copper Mine participated by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Corporation, and to other companies, this loan contributes to securing a long-term, stable supply of copper, an important metal resource for Japan.\n\n \n\nJBIC will continue to support the overseas infrastructure business activities of Japanese companies by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming functions, and contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Project finance is a financing scheme in which repayments are made solely from cash flows generated by the project and secured only on the project assets.\n\n*2 JBIC financially supports Sierra Gorda Copper Mine Project.

(Garanti Bank), the major commercial bank in Turkey, for offering an export credit line*1 amounting up to the equivalent of 300 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion) to finance Japanese exports to Turkey and its neighboring countries (including in the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa).  The credit line is cofinanced*2 with private financial institutions which brings the overall cofinancing amount to the equivalent of 500 million U.S. dollars. \n\n \n\nUnder this agreement, an export credit line is offered to Garanti Bank to extend loans to local companies in Turkey and its neighboring countries for the purchase of Japanese machinery and equipment for infrastructure development; as well as those related to renewable energy (such as geothermal, wind, biomass, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy); and those related to the sector of climate change mitigation (such as thermal power plants with CCS*3 facilities, CCS projects, waste to energy projects, hybrid power*4 plants, combined heat & power projects, district heating and/or cooling related projects). This export credit line will thus provide medium- and long-term loans, either in yen or in U.S. dollars, through Garanti Bank, thus supporting the expansion of the export of Japanese machinery and equipment to these countries.\n\n \n\nIn recent years, there have been growing expectations for Japanese exports of machinery and equipment to Turkey and its neighboring countries through collaboration between Japanese and Turkish companies. Under these circumstances, there has been growing interest in a variety of export businesses, and expectations on the major role JBIC should play therein. This credit line will support the export of machinery and equipment to these countries, thereby contributing to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries. \n\n \n\nJBIC and Garanti Bank have built up close cooperative ties by signing the memorandum of understanding*5 in November 2012 to exchange information and explore the future cooperation in financing.

   "NR/2012-161\n\nMarch 29, 2013\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, Governor: Hiroshi Okuda) signed today a loan agreement in the aggregate amount of up to 702 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion) with Cernambi Norte MV26 B.V. (CMV26), a company incorporated in the Netherlands in which MODEC, Inc. (MODEC), Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., and Marubeni Corporation have equity stakes. The loan, provided as project financing*1, will support a project in which a long-term FPSO*2 system chartering service will be offered by CMV26 to Tupi B.V., a consortium which has a concession in the Iracema Norte*3 area of a pre-salt oil field off the coast of Brazil, and was formed in the Netherlands by Petr—leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), a state-owned oil company in Brazil, and others*4. The loan is cofinanced with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (lead arranger), Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation. The total cofinancing amount is 1,170 million U.S. dollars.\n\n \n\nIn this project, MODEC will build an ultra-deep FPSO unit capable of operating 2,000 to 3,000 meters underwater and with the capacity to produce up to 150 thousand barrels of crude oil and 280 million cubic feet of gas per day, and store about 1,600 thousand barrels of crude oil. CMV26 and a joint venture which is established mainly by an affiliated company of MODEC in Brazil will provide charter services (leasing and operation and maintenance services) to Tupi B.V. for 20 years. The FPSO vessel will be deployed for developing the Iracema Norte area.\n\n \n\nAs oil companies in a number of countries have been actively developing offshore oil fields in recent years, they foresee an increasing need for new FPSO systems, primarily in Latin America (namely Brazil) and the Western African region. In particular, a series of world-class oil and gas reserves has been discovered beneath the geological formation of pre-salt layers of Brazilian offshore waters and have attracted worldwide attention to huge deposits consisting mainly of medium-gravity and light oil. This is the 4th FPSO Operation Project by MODEC for an oil field of pre-salt layers, following Lula field (former Tupi field)*5, Guara field*6, and Cernambi South field*7. \n\n \n\nThe Basic Act on Ocean Policy, which came into force in July 2007, and the Ocean Energy and Mineral Resource Development Plan, prepared at a meeting of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy (headed by the Prime Minister) in March 2009 based on the cabinet decision on the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy in March 2008, stipulates: \"Japan should aim to develop methane hydrate and submarine hydrothermal fields in waters around Japan on a commercial basis in 10 years (by 2019).\" In this project, Japanese underwater energy resource development companies provide an FPSO charter service in the growing degree of difficulty in the development of deeper offshore fields, which is an indispensable component for offshore resource development. Therefore, this loan will lead to the strengthening the international competitiveness of Japanese companies in offshore resource development by helping them acquire and improve technologies, management practices, and knowhow regarding the operation of ultra-deepwater FPSO systems, thereby this financing is expected to contribute to the securing of access to resources and their stable supply of natural resources to Japan.\n\n \n\nIn light of the Basic Act on Ocean Policy and the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, JBIC will support the development and acquisition of strategically important resources to Japan, as well as the maintenance and improvement of the international competitiveness of Japanese marine industries.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Project finance is a financing scheme whereby the repayment of a loan extended to a project relies on cash flows generated by the operation of the project, with collateral limited to project goods and other assets.\n\n*2 A floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) system is a floating vessel for the first stage processing of crude oil produced at the oil well, which separates associated gas and water, and for the storage and offloading of oil.\n\n*3 The Iracema Norte area of a pre-salt oil field, a giant oil field located about 300 kilometers off the south coast of Rio de Janeiro, lies below an underwater pre-salt (rock salt) layer in the Santos Basin.\n\n*4 The consortium constitutes Petrobras, BG Group, Galp Energia in Portugal and China Petrochemical Corporation in China all of which hold groups of companies.\n\n*5 See Press release on March 31, 2010. \n\n*6 See Press release on June 29, 2011.\n\n*7 See Press release on March 28, 2012.",

   "NR/2013-86\n\nSeptember 27, 2013\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, Governor: Hiroshi Okuda) signed today  a loan agreement totaling up to 508.2 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion) with T.E.N Ghana MV25 B.V. (TGMV25), a company incorporated in the Netherlands in which MODEC, Inc. (MODEC), Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Marubeni Corporation, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., have equity stakes. The loan, provided as project financing,*1 will be provided as necessary financing for a project in which a long-term FPSO*2  system chartering service will be offered by TGMV25 to Tullow Ghana Limited incorporated in Jersey, which is also a subsidiary of Tullow Oil plc in Great Britain, and will engage in the development of T.E.N. (Tweneboa, Enyenra, Ntomme) Oil Field*3 as their operator. The loan is cofinanced with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (lead arranger), The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Mizuho Bank Ltd., ING Bank N.V., and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. The total cofinancing amount is 847 million U.S. dollars. This loan is the first project financing FPSO project for JBIC in Ghana.\n\n \n\nIn this project, MODEC will build a deepwater FPSO unit capable of operating more than 1,000 meters underwater, and with the capacity to produce up to 80 thousand barrels of crude oil and 170 million cubic feet of gas per day, and store about 1.7 million barrels of crude oil. TGMV25 will provide charter services (leasing and operation and maintenance services) to Tullow Ghana Limited for 10 years. The FPSO vessel will be deployed for developing T.E.N Oil Field.\n\n \n\nThe Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, issued in April 2013 after revision, as a cabinet decision under the Basic Act on Ocean Policy which came into force in July 2007, stipulates: \"Japan should advance technology development for methane hydrate, which is expected to exit in substantial amount in waters around Japan, in order to start projects for commercialized undertakings led by private sector companies in the late 2020's, while keeping sights on international developments.\" As marine resource development has been increasingly moving toward sophistication such as through further ultra-deep water activities, this loan will lead to the strengthening of the international competitiveness of Japanese companies in offshore resource development by helping them acquire and improve technologies, management practices, and knowhow regarding the operation of ultra-deepwater FPSO systems. Thereby, this financing is expected to contribute to the securing of access to resources and  stable supply of natural resources to Japan.\n\n \n\nThe promotion of investment and trade through collaboration between the public and private sector in the African region was announced by the government of Japan at the TICAD V, and this loan is made, under the JBIC Facility for African Investment and Trade Enhancement (\"FAITH\")*4 , to support the promotion of private sector-led growth and the acceleration of infrastructure development in  African countries.   \n\n \n\nIn light of the Basic Act on Ocean Policy and the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, JBIC will continue to support Japanese companies'business deployment in overseas regions, including Africa, where offshore resource development is active, while keeping in mind the development and acquisition of strategically important resources to Japan, as well as the maintenance and improvement of the international competitiveness of Japanese marine industries\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Project finance is a financing scheme whereby the repayment of a loan extended to a project relies on cash flows generated by the operation of the project, with collateral limited to project goods and other assets.\n\n*2 A floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) system is a floating vessel for the first stage processing of crude oil produced at the oil well, which separates associated gas and water, and for the storage and offloading of oil.\n\n*3 A huge oil field located about 60 kilometers offshore of Ghana.\n\n*4 See Information on June 3, 2013",

(Tokyo Gas). The loan is cofinanced with private financial institutions, with the overall cofinancing amount reaching USD265 million.\n\n \n\nThis is one of the world's largest-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects where Tokyo Gas, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tokyo Gas Gorgon Pty Ltd (TGG) in the Commonwealth of Australia, and five other companies comprising Chevron Corporation (Chevron), Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. jointly develop large-scale gas fields including Gorgon and Jansz fields, off the northwest coast of the state of Western Australia and transport gas through undersea pipelines to a liquefaction plant on Barrow Island located in the same state. The plant is expected to produce and sell up to 15 million tons of LNG annually from the year 2015. This loan will finance TGG for developing this Project in which TGG has a 1.0 percent interest. The aggregate amount of LNG which Tokyo Gas will offtake from this Project is 1,250 thousand tons per year (1,100 thousand tons purchased from Chevron, and 150 thousand tons corresponding to TGG's participating interest.).\n\n \n\nThe global demand of LNG is projected to increase due to growing demand in emerging countries and heightened environmental awareness. In Japan, there have been increasing hopes for a stable supply of LNG in recent years. However, LNG supply from Indonesia, Japan's major LNG supply source, is expected to decrease significantly, and the renewal time is approaching for a number of long-term purchase contracts with other countries. This prospect has made Australia, with its abundant gas reserves and political and economic stability, increasingly important as a supply source of LNG. In this context, supporting Japanese companies for developing energy resources in this Project has a significant importance for securing a stable LNG supply to Japan.\n\n \n\nThis loan will support a Japanese gas utility's participation in an energy resource development project in an important energy resource supply country and securing a stable supply of LNG.

   "27 January 2014\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Hiroshi Watanabe) signed on January 25, upon the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe's visit in India, a loan agreement with two facilities amounting up to approximately 155 million U.S. dollars, (JBIC portion) and  approximately 55 million U.S. dollars (JBIC portion), respectively with the NTPC Limited (\"NTPC\"). The loans are cofinanced with the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the total amount of cofinancing for each facility is approximately 259 million U.S. dollars and 91 million U.S. dollars, respectively.*1\n\n \n\nThese loans are intended to finance the NTPC to purchase, from Toshiba JSW Power Systems Private Limited, which is a local subsidiary of the Toshiba Corporation (TJPS) in India, Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) and Ebara Corporation (Ebara), steam turbine generators (produced by TJPS and partially by Toshiba), and boiler feed water pumps (produced by Ebara) in order to construct supercritical coal-fired power plants (3_800MW) in the Kudgi district of the Karnataka state in southern India.\n\n \n\nThe Indian economy has continued to grow quickly in recent years, and chronic power shortages on the back of increasing power demand is a big problem for Japanese companies deploying their businesses in India.*2 Given the circumstance, the government of India set a high priority on the development of power supply and plans a large-scale electricity facilities reinforcement under the 12th five-year economic plan (2012-2017). Therefore, the construction of a large number of new power plant and rehabilitation projects for existing power plants are expected to be carried out in the country.\n\n \n\nNTPC, established in 1975, is India's largest power company. The capacity of its power generating facilities accounts for 16% of the whole country, and the amount of power generated by them makes up 25% of the total power generated. NTPC is also one of the major companies in Asia. As the largest power company in India, NTPC is expected to play an important role in power facility enhancement within the 12th five-year economic plan. Under the situation where the construction of several new power plants is planned for the future, an expectation for the expansion of business opportunities is also increasing for Japanese companies, which possess a high level of technology. In such a situation, these loans, which JBIC provides comprehensive support for infrastructure business deployment by Japanese companies, will support Japanese companies for winning orders and expanding sales, thereby contributing to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of the Japanese industry. In addition, it is expected that various cooperation between NTPC and Japanese companies in the power infrastructure area will be further deepened by strengthening the relationship between JBIC and NTPC through these loans. JBIC have provided TJPS with a loan for their construction of manufacturing plants and other relevant funds.*3  Therefore, this time, JBIC is providing multi-faceted support for the overseas business of a Japanese company through making a loan for the sale of the turbine equipment produced in TJPS's manufacturing plant mentioned above.\n\n \n\nAs Japan's policy-based financial institution, JBIC will continue to support the Japanese companies'overseas business deployment and export of Japanese infrastructure system to India as well as opportunities for Japanese companies to participate in the country's business projects by drawing on its financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming function.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) will provide Buyer's Credit Insurance and Overseas Untied Loan Insurance for the portion cofinanced by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\n*2 According to the ÒFY2013 Survey (the 25th) Report on Overseas Business Operations by Japanese Manufacturing CompaniesÓ conducted by JBIC, approximately 60% of the Japanese companies running projects in India indicated problems with power infrastructure in the country.

   "January 27, 2014\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Hiroshi Watanabe) signed on January 25, upon the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo AbeÕs visit in India, a loan agreement amounting up to approximately 4.8 billion yen (JBIC portion) with the NTPC Limited (ÒNTPCÓ). The loans are cofinanced with the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the total amount of cofinancing is approximately 8 billion yen.*1\n\n \n\nThe purpose of this loan is to provide funds for the NTPC to purchase gas turbines and control systems (produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (MHI)) from the Marubeni Corporation, and MHI, in for the renovation and modernisation project at a gas combined-cycle power plant (facility capacity of 663.36MW) in the Auraiya district of the Uttar Pradesh Province in northern India.\n\n \n\nThe Indian economy has continued to grow quickly in recent years, and chronic power shortages on the back of increasing power demand is a big problem for Japanese companies deploying their businesses in India.*2 Given the circumstance, the government of India set a high priority on the development of power supply and plans a large-scale electricity facilities reinforcement under the 12th five-year economic plan (2012-2017). Therefore, the construction of a large number of new power plant and rehabilitation projects for existing power plants are expected to be carried out in the country.\n\n \n\nNTPC, established in 1975, is IndiaÕs largest power company. The capacity of its power generating facilities accounts for 16% of the whole country, and the amount of power generated by them makes up 25% of the total power generated. NTPC is also one of the major companies in Asia. As the largest power company in India, NTPC is expected to play an important role in power facility enhancement within the 12th five-year economic plan. Under the situation where the construction of several new power plants is planned for the future, an expectation for the expansion of business opportunities is also increasing for Japanese companies, which possess a high level of technology. This loan aims to contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries through export to India by Japanese companies. It is also expected that various cooperation between NTPC and Japanese companies in the area of power infrastructure will be further deepened by strengthening the relationship between JBIC and NTPC through this loan.\n\n \n\nAs JapanÕs policy-based financial institution, JBIC will continue to support the Japanese companiesÕ overseas business deployment and export of Japanese infrastructure system to India as well as opportunities for Japanese companies to participate in the country's business projects by drawing on its financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and performing its risk-assuming function.\n\n \n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) will provide BuyerÕs Credit Insurance and Overseas Untied Loan Insurance for the portion cofinanced by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\n*2 According to the ÒFY2013 Survey (the 25th) Report on Overseas Business Operations by Japanese Manufacturing CompaniesÓ conducted by JBIC, approximately 60% of the Japanese companies running projects in India indicated problems with power infrastructure in the country.

   "February 17, 2014\n\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Hiroshi Watanabe) signed today, a loan agreement totaling up to USD300 million (JBIC portion) with Japan Canada Oil Sands Limited (JACOS). The loan is cofinanced with Mizuho Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, with the overall cofinancing amount reaching USD600 million.\n\n \n\nThe loan is intended to finance the further development and production of undeveloped oil sands adjacent to the area currently in production at Hangingstone Mine located in Northern Alberta, Canada, which JACOS holds 75% of participating interests. JACOS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Oil Sands Co. Ltd. that is invested mainly by Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Ltd.\n\n \n\nCanada holds the world's third largest proven reserves of crude oil. It is anticipated that the oil production will largely increase by the progress of development, and the oil sands, which are a non-conventional resource, will account for most of this increase. In this expansion, JACOS will adopt the Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) *1method that the company has promoted in this business, which is to extract bitumen*2 directly from the underground oil sands layers.  JACOS plans to secure the prorated portion of produced bitumen, an initial daily output of approximately 20,000 barrels, according to the equity interest ratio. The loan has important significance in securing the stable supply of important natural resources to Japan, as well as acquiring the experience and knowhow of oil sands development through supporting JACOS'resource development business. This will lead to the possible future development of neighboring oil sands mines and thus, it is expected to contribute to further business development of Japanese companies. \n\n \n\nAs Japan's policy-based financial institution, JBIC will continue to support the development and acquisition of important natural resources, by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes for structuring projects and by performing its risk-assuming function.\n\nNote\n\n\n\n*1 SAGD technology is to dig two horizontal wells, and raise fluidity of oil sands upon heating the oil sands layer by injecting high pressure hot steam through the injection well (upper well) and collect condensed water flowing into the producer well (lower well).\n\n*2 Bitumen is crude oil of high clay which does not have fluidity, and is transported through a pipeline after being diluted usually in condensate.",

The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.\n\n\n\nThe Eolo project involves the construction of a 44 megawatt wind farm in Rivas Province on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. Eolo consists of 22 Gamesa G90 2 megawatt wind turbine generators, as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generators to a high-voltage substation. It is estimated that Eolo will be able to generate approximately 169.6 gigawatt hours of electricity per year, without requiring any fossil fuel supply. The wind farm is expected to start operations by December of 2012 and the electricity will be purchased by local distribution companies Distribuidora de Electricidad del Norte, S.A.

CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s energy sector has suffered from a lack of investment during the last 10 years, as the country struggled with civil conflict. Now that the countryâ€™s situation is improving, a significant increase in energy investment is necessary to meet the populationâ€™s needs and support further development. Tapping CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s gas resources will reduce the countryâ€™s energy costs and limit the use of foreign reserves for energy imports. \n\n\n\nThe project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ€™s Country Assistance Strategy for CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, which stresses the critical importance of building energy capacity to sustain economic progress.\n\n\n\nMIGAâ€™s support for this investment is also aligned with the agencyâ€™s strategy of supporting investments in countries eligible for concessional financing by the International Development Association, countries affected by conflict, and complex infrastructure projects.",

   "8296  In December 2012, MIGA issued guarantees totaling $116.1 million covering an investment by Globeleq Holdings (Azito) Limited of Bermuda in the Azito Thermal Power Plant in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe project involves the conversion of the existing Azito Thermal Power Plant from simple-cycle to combined-cycle. This will include the addition of a steam turbine generator and heat recovery systems as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generator to the plantâ€™s 225 kV substation. The project will add approximately 140 megawatts of installed capacity to the grid, without requiring any additional gas supply, for a total plant installed capacity of approximately 430 megawatts. Since the expansion from a simple-cycle to a combined-cycle plant was foreseen when the first phase of the project was completed in 1999, the related facilities and transmission line were designed to accommodate the full plant expansion and output.\n\n\n\nCÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s energy infrastructure suffers from lack of maintenance, system overload, and financial difficulties. Due to limited access, over three-quarters of households are dependent on cheap wood charcoal, though this has environmental and health costs in the long term. The project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ€™s Country Assistance Strategy for CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, which stresses the critical importance of building energy capacity to sustain economic progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIGAâ€™s support for this investment is also aligned with the agencyâ€™s strategy of supporting investments into countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association, countries affected by conflict, and complex infrastructure projects.",

(APSCL) in Bangladesh. HSBC coordinated and arranged a $406 million financing package to APSCL for the project. On March 8, 2013, MIGA issued additional coverage of $30 million covering a swap arrangement to hedge against long-term interest rate risk. MIGAâ€™s guarantees are for a period of up to 13.5 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations. The Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh has provided an unconditional sovereign guarantee covering payment obligations of APSCL under the debt financing and the swap.\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the construction of a 450-megawatt combined cycle gas-fired plant on the basis of a contract awarded by APSCL to a consortium of TSK Electronica y Electricidad S.A. (Spain) and Inelectra International AB (Sweden). This project will replace certain existing units in the Ashuganj facility that will be decommissioned once the new plant is completed.\n\n\n\nBangladesh currently faces an acute shortage of power generation capacity. This impairs the country's economic and social development and constrains growth. The government of Bangladesh has made energy a high priority and recently adopted an updated Power Sector Master Plan, which includes this project. This project will help meet the countryâ€˜s growing demand for power, using a domestic gas resource and efficient technology.\n\n\n\nMIGA's participation in this transaction is critical to mobilizing the debt financing for this project. The project is consistent with MIGA's strategic priorities of supporting investment into IDA countries and complex projects.",

MIGA also issued a guarantee of $11.1 million to CfC Stanbic Bank, a subsidiary of Standard Bank of South Africa, covering its swap arrangement with Triumph to hedge against long-term interest rate risk. The coverage to all guarantee holders is for a period of up to 12 years against the risk of breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the construction of an 83 megawatt heavy fuel oil plant on a build, own, and operate basis. The plant will be located at Kitengela, near the Athi River, approximately 25 kilometers from Nairobi. Triumph will enter into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company.\n\n\n\nThe World Bankâ€™s Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic found that the lack of adequate, reliable electricity supply is Kenyaâ€™s largest infrastructure challenge and a key constraint to economic growth (contributing to economic losses of an estimated 2 percent of GDP). The project will help Kenya achieve a more diversified energy mix and stability to its power generation. The country remains heavily dependent on hydropower, which is frequently negatively impacted by drought. Installed thermal capacity provides a less expensive alternative to investments in emergency diesel-fired plants.\n\n\n\nThe project is further supported by a partial risk guarantee from the World Bankâ€™s International Development Association that backstops a letter of credit from JP Morgan Bank of London.\n\n\n\nMIGAâ€™s guarantees are aligned with the Agencyâ€™s strategy of supporting investments in countries eligible for lending from the International Development Association, investments in complex projects, and South-South investments.",

The coverage is for a period of 13 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations.\n\n\n\nThe project involves the construction of a second powerhouse with four additional turbine generators with a total additional capacity of 700 megawatts on the basis of an engineering, procurement, and construction contract awarded to Odebrecht SA of Brazil. The Cambambe plant is one of two hydroelectric power stations currently in operation on the Kwanza River. The project is part of a larger rehabilitation and expansion program being undertaken by the government of Angola, under which the countryâ€™s generation capacity is set to increase from around 1,500 megawatts to over 5,000 megawatts.\n\n\n\nAfter decades of underinvestment into the power sector, Angola suffers from chronic electricity shortages that are hampering the countryâ€™s economic development. A recent government policy document, â€œPolicy and National Energy Security Strategyâ€ estimated that only 30 percent of the population has access to the power distribution network.  Electricity from this project will offer an economic and efficient means of increasing the electricity supply. Rebuilding and improving critical infrastructure is a pillar of the World Bankâ€™s strategy for Angolaâ€™s development.

   "IFC Project 27849. ContourGlobal Togo S.A. has entered into a 25-year concession and power purchase agreement to develop, construct and operate a 100MW thermal power plant on a brown-field site in LomÃ©, Togo. The Project will be the first substantial foreign investment in Togo in over a decade and will be one of the most significant investments in the West African power sector in over twenty years. Construction began in May 2009 and is expected to be completed and operational in April 2010. The plant can be powered by natural gas, heavy fuel oil, and distillate diesel oil. HFO will be the primary source of fuel until NG becomes available via the West African Gas Pipeline. The total project cost is estimated at about $189 million.

Project description: MIGA has issued a guarantee of $88.3 million to Ormat Holding Corp., a Cayman Islands-registered subsidiary of Ormat Technologies, Inc., for its $98.1 million equity investment in OrPower 4, Inc. in the Republic of Kenya. The coverage is for up to 15 years and covers the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation. This issuance replaces an earlier guarantee issued by the agency to cover investments into the first phase of the project only. The expanded guarantee covers both the first phase of the project and the investorâ€™s additional investments of $50 million for the second phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the design, construction, management and operation of a base-load geothermal power plant with a combined capacity of 48MW on a Build-Own-Operate basis in the Olkaria geothermal fields of the Rift Valley, 50 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. Electricity generated by the plant will be sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement with the national power transmission and distribution utility in the countryâ€”the Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso funded by OPIC:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52 MW expansion of CHP geothermal power plant for a beverage bottler",
