The project (La Confluencia or the project) consists of the development, construction, and operation of a 158 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant to be located in the Tinguiririca and Portillo Valleys east of the city of San Fernando in Region VI of Chile. The project area is located in the foot hills of the Andes Mountains, approximately 75km south east of the city of San Fernando. Being a run-of-the-river hydropower plant, the project will generate power at a very low cost and will be among the first power plants in the system to be dispatched. The project is located in a remote and mountainous area and is expected to have a very small environmental footprint. The project supports the World Bank Group‚Äôs emphasis on promoting low-cost renewable energy.\n\n\n\nTotal project cost is estimated at $334 million, of which IFC is expected to contribute $208 million through a combination of:\n\n\n\n- an IFC A Loan of up to $83 million for IFC‚Äôs own account, and \n\n- an IFC B Loan of up to $125 million for the account of participants.",

The project will accomplish this by helping REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and economic agents. The project will be comprised of three components: (i) the electricity component, which will support urgent investments to rehabilitate the electricity supply system and reduce the supply/demand gap; (ii) the water component, which will support short-term investments to increase access to water supply, reduce losses and reinforce the capacity of the supply and distribution system; and (iii) the institutional component, which will support the strengthening of the capacities of both REGIDESO and MWEM. A quantitative analysis of costs and benefits of the Bujumbura water supply investment program yielded a net present value (calculated with a 12 percent discount rate) of US$0.7 million. The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the urban water supply program is estimated at 13.0 percent. The ERR figures have been calculated on the basis of the following benefits: (i) incremental amount of water supplied, valued with water tariffs; (ii) consumer surplus; and (iii) cost savings resulting from the improved operating performances.",

This will be a time slice of the three EDEs investment program in this activity by: (a) replacing existing run-down and aged medium and low voltage overhead lines; (b) expanding distribution substations and feeders; (c) replacing and installing meters, cables and transformers, and new connections for those customers who have irregular connections; (d) for large consumers, installing remote meters; and (e) in areas difficult to manage, installing theft-proof equipment. The specific sub-projects have already been selected by the EDEs, based primarily on the contribution they would make to improve the Cash Recovery Index (CRI). The second component is the outreach to consumer communities receiving component one investments, in order to re-establish trust and define clear rules between them and the EDEs, in the context of the 24 hours of light program of improving power supply in areas where the CRI is rising. Finally, the third component is the technical assistance and training for consultants to: (i) confirm the amounts and legal status of the EDEs' debts, define options for its restructuring, and prepare a plan of execution; (ii) carry out audits on the performance of the contractors on the project works, the achievement of project performance indicators, and the flow of funds provided by the Government to the sector; (iii) survey customer satisfaction with the quality o f electricity service in the rehabilitated circuits; and (iv) help administer, monitor and evaluate the project.",

Nine subprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. The Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model as a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in other high energy consuming provinces. An EPP can be developed at about half the cost of a coal-fired power plant. \n\n\n\nThe outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an efficiency power plant (EPP) to be developed with annual 532 GWh energy savings and an equivalent 107 MW capacity, (ii) development of the energy service sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for promoting and assessing energy efficiency projects, and (iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces, implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of coal, resulting in emission reductions of 415,460 t/y of CO2, 1,785 t/y of total suspended particulates, 4,795 t/y of SO2, and 1,068 t/y of NOx.",

The broad objectives of the government's post-conflict program, as detailed in its Letter of Development Policy (LDP), focus on: (i) implementing the key elements of the Ouagadougou Accord to restore peace and security and promote national reconciliation and reunification of the country; (ii) restoring basic infrastructure and social services in the country; (iii) restoring fiscal and debt sustainability; and (iv) sustaining an incipient economic recovery through structural reforms in the key energy, cocoa and financial sectors. Achieving these strategic goals requires improving governance, transparency and economic efficiency and strengthening the basic functions of government, based on accountability and the rule of law.",

The Ambuklao and Binga hydroelectric power plants are being privatized as a package through an international tender process, as part of the privatization program under a comprehensive sector reform law, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA). At privatization, expected to occur in June 2008, the plants will be owned by SN Aboitiz Power Benguet, Inc. (SNAPB), a joint-venture between SN Power Invest (SN Power) of Norway and Aboitiz Equity Venture (AEV) of the Philippines. IFC‚Äôs proposed investment, a loan, will be in parallel with additional financing from Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) and local banks and will support the privatization.\n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment will partly finance the privatization and rehabilitation of the 75MW Ambuklao hydroelectric power plant and the 100MW Binga hydroelectric power plant, currently owned by National Power Corporation (NPC). The rehabilitation will re-commission the Ambuklao plant, which has been shut down due to silt problems, upgrade the Binga plant, and increase the combined capacity by 50MW in total (30MW for Ambuklao and 20MW for Binga) from 175MW to 225MW. They will operate as peaking plants, supplying power to the Luzon grid for about five hours daily. There are no electric transmission system constraints with regard to the expected higher generation levels.\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is currently estimated around $560 Million. The sources include IFC A Loan up to $85 million and IFC C Loan up to $15 million, NIB loan up to $60 Million, local banks consortium up to $200 million and the remaining amount is expected to be financed by equity and internally generated cashflow. The uses include acquisition price of $325 million and rehabilitation/refurbishment capex around $170 million. The estimated project cost is preliminary and subject to further discussions. The sponsors are currently under discussions with suppliers to finalize the project costs. However, this will not affect loan financing as additional costs will all be covered by additional equity.",

The main risk under this operation is related to the rising and widely fluctuating international energy prices particularly of petroleum products, which create instability in domestic energy costs and may induce the Government to suspend or only partially implement the continued pass-through of cost increases to consumers. This risk is mitigated by: (a) the Government's commitment for reform and actions to reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, invest in efficient and least cost facilities and to diversify; and (b) the existing regulations and price adjustment mechanisms for electricity services as well as for petroleum products allowing for monthly or quarterly adjustments.",

Bartrac Equipment is a joint venture between two Caterpillar dealers operating in Africa, Barloworld Equipment and Tractafric Equipment. MIGA‚Äôs guarantee is for up to 10 years and covers the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation.\n\n\n\nThe project involves the establishment of a dealership in the Katanga province of the DRC for the distribution and servicing of Caterpillar earth-moving and power generating equipment. The project will directly supply equipment suitable for the construction and rehabilitation of road and rail links, office and residential buildings, and power sector installations in the Katanga province. An office block, workshop facilities, and spare parts warehouse will be set up at Lubumbashi, provincial capital of Katanga Province, and Kolwezi, a mining town.\n\n\n\nThe project is designed to indirectly address the infrastructure needs of the DRC, which is in a very poor state following decades of conflicts and economic and political instability. The earth-moving equipment will help build the country's road network and tackle one of its biggest challenges‚Äîtraveling between provinces. Increased availability of earth-moving equipment and maintenance services will help enhance efficiency and productivity in the mining sector, and is expected to encourage downstream growth.",

The project's main impact will be to prevent a possible catastrophe resulting from a dam failure. Such a catastrophe can result in significant loss of life and damage to property of persons living in downstream areas. It will also cause a major and prolonged fall in hydropower production that will severely affect the entire population of Albania and will likely significantly increase electricity prices in the whole South East Europe (SEE) region. Poor and vulnerable people in the region will likely suffer disproportionately from any such electricity price increases. The project consists of two main components: (1) physical infrastructure investments; and (2) technical assistance. Physical infrastructure investments include: (i) the specification and implementation of water alarm systems in the Drin and Mat River basins, and specification of an Emergency Action Plan; (ii) rehabilitation of spillways on Fierza, Koman and Vau i Dejes dams on the Drin river; (iii) rehabilitation of electromechanical equipment in the Koman dam; and (iv) implementation of Load Frequency Control system in Vau i Dejes and Fierza Dams. The technical assistance component will finance: (i) hydrology studies and water management; (ii) implementation consultants; (iii) studies for new hydropower development; (iv) financial management systems capacity building; and (v) international panel of experts on safety of Dams.",

Pamir 1 HPP is a part of the Pamir Private Power Project in the Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) of Tajikistan - one of the poorest regions in the world. The additional financing for an unanticipated financing gap will enable the project Pamir Energy Company (PEC) to complete the original project scope by focusing on rehabilitation of plant infrastructure and provision of parts and equipment to ensure the plant's long-term sustained operation and prevent further accidents.",

The objectives of the Mining Environmental Restoration Project (GP) are to: (a) strengthen Government of Argentina (GOA) capacity to assess and mitigate environmental risks associated with closed uranium mines, processing sites, and related mining sector investments, in accordance with international good practice; and (b) reduce potential economic and health damages associated with a closed uranium milling site in Malargue and Mendoza. There are three components to the project. The first component is the remediation of the Malargue site. The project will fund remediation works, including the safe disposal of 710,000 tons of tailings and soils, structures to prevent groundwater contamination and dust, and measures to abate radiation and radon emissions. Contracting has been done in conformance with World Bank procedures and civil works have already begun (and as of May, 2008, the required investment is about 30 percent complete). Independent construction supervision conducted by a Bank-hired technical expert has reviewed the design and certified the quality of construction to date. The second component is the mine restoration planning and institutional strengthening. The project will provide technical assistance to study and design remediation options to clean up the additional sites, and support the environmental and social consultation processes required as per international best practice. The project will also fund an international advisory group to advice on the approaches being suggested for each site. Finally, the third component is the project management. The project implementation unit of the GP will be responsible for project implementation, reporting, project monitoring, and impact evaluation of key interventions.",

Mali still has a very low rural electrification access rate. According to the National Directorate of Energy (DNE), in 2007 only about 17 percent of the population has access to electricity. In urban areas the access rate is about 30 percent and it is about 7 percent in rural areas. These low access rates are not allowing Mali to fully harness its economic potentials to compete fairly on international markets. Most rural households meet their lighting and small power needs with kerosene, dry cell, and car batteries. They do not have any form of modern energy for lighting or for operating equipment. This additional financing is intended to mainly finance energy services delivery sub-projects (both bottom up and top down) consistent with its initial development objective. The successful experience of the spontaneous bottom up projects under HEURA has demonstrated the potential for energy services delivery schemes in rural Mali led by local private operators. This experience needs to be sustained by adequate and predictable financing to avoid loosing the momentum created. The bottom up rural electrification approach needs to be complemented by large scale projects which have greater scaling up potential in the sense that they can deliver the majority of connections in the long run.",

   "EBRD Project Number 38838: This is financing for construction and operation of a 156MW wind farm located in the Kavarna region, in the north-eastern part of Bulgaria about 3km inland from the Black Sea. \n\n\n\nThe project will contribute approximately 1 percent of Bulgaria‚Äôs energy consumption and will significantly increase Bulgaria‚Äôs wind generation capacity, as currently only one other large-scale farm (35MW) has been constructed in the country.\n\n\n\nThe site is located away from the sensitive steppe areas, residential areas and a minimum of 3 km inland from the coast. The project may affect migratory birds under very specific weather conditions but appropriate mitigating factors would be implemented to address this identified risk such as switching off turbines if radar and/or professional ornithologist observers indicated that migratory birds may be at risk. The due diligence confirmed that, taking account of commitments to mitigation, there will be no significant negative impacts to any Natura 2000 sites or avifauna.\n\n\n\nThe European Bank of Reconstruction and Development loan for this project is EURO 67,843,000, according to CEE Bankwatch.",

   "Project ID: P095510: The Environmental Sustainability Development Policy Loan (DPL) supports the Government of Mexico's medium-term, outcome-based program to promote sustainable development. The overarching objective of the DPL operation is to balance socio-economic development with environmental protection and improvement. The operation will complement actions supported by the recently approved climate change DPL and will further pursue the general objectives of a previous Environment DPL Program, by integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies and programs of key development sectors: tourism, energy, forestry, water, agriculture, and housing as prioritized by the government of Mexico (GOM). The original Environment DPL Program supported environmental mainstreaming in four of these sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, and water); the other two (agriculture and housing) have been included at the GOM's request. Macroeconomic risks are associated with effects on the Mexican economy of: (i) a sharper slowdown of the US (and global) economy, decelerating growth of non-oil exports and reducing the flow of workers' remittances, (ii) higher levels of international commodity and food prices leading to further pressures on domestic inflation, (iii) increased uncertainty with respect to credit conditions for the access of emerging markets to the international capital markets, and (iv) declining oil production. However, several factors are in place to reduce these risks, including: a healthy financial system that has begun to expand domestic credit as a share of GDP; more dynamism in exports to non-US destinations; favorable terms of trade with high oil prices; and the further consolidation of prudent macroeconomic policies in both the fiscal and monetary realms.",

The Food Crisis Development Support Credit Project in Bangladesh along with the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has sought to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable groups: (i) food grain, particularly rice, is being made available to the poor at subsidized prices; (ii) existing safety net programs are being scaled up; (iii) a new safety net program, an employment guarantee scheme, has been initiated to help people in distressed areas-such as those that periodically suffer from extreme food shortages, known in the local dialect as Monga-abtain employment during lean agricultural periods; and (iv) ensuring the adequate and timely availability of farm inputs including seeds, fertilizer and diesel to farmers. The FY09 budget has significantly increased allocations to assist the poor deal with the food crisis. GOB has requested all stakeholders including the development partners to assist in this effort. The Bank has been requested to provide budget-support under its Global Food Response Program (GFW) to assist GOB'S measures to maintain macroeconomic stability, ensure food security in the immediate short-run, and help those affected by rising food prices.",

The master plan will tie together generation, transmission, and distribution expansion to ensure that all proposed capital investments are part of a long-term, structured plan rather than ad hoc. As significant hydropower generation projects are in the planning and implementation stages, particular attention will focus on transmission system expansion plans to ensure their adequacy and that they are coordinated with the existing and already planned generation expansion. Broad social and environmental issues relating to energy sytem planning will be identified in association with determination of potential hydropower sites, biomass fueled generation facilities and other renewable energy options during the executiion of the TA. These issues will be more precisely addressed in other renewable energy options during the execution of the TA.",

   "Project #37399- 01; Outcome: Dagachhu Hydropower Development. The impact of the Project is to sustain the country's inclusive economic growth by promoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. Accelerating the development of hydropower for export is of strategic significance for Bhutan\u0019s economy. Given the Government\u0019s limited fiscal capacity for large infrastructure projects, the hydropower development strategy is to leverage public and private investments through private participation in development projects. This approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, and generate income for more socioeconomic development. To promote the country\u0019s strategy, the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) supported the Government in establishing a policy and institutional framework for public and private participation in hydropower development. The Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP facility in line with the Hydropower Development Policy, which is to promote private and foreign investments for hydropower generation in Bhutan. Further TA support will be provided to develop Government capacity for hydropower export.\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 37399-043.\n\n\n\nThe Green Power Development Project was approved on 29 October 2008. It includes two components: (i) hydropower development and (ii) rural electrification. Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126 megawatt (MW) run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The second component provides access to electricity in rural areas for around 9,000 rural households and public facilities on an on-grid and off-grid basis using renewable energy sources (i.e., hydropower and solar power).¬†The proposed additional financing will ensure successful completion of Dagachhu hydropower development where the construction cost has overrun mainly due to unexpected geological conditions in the underground excavation works and their relevant price escalation. The project site is in the southwestern area of Bhutan around 50 km away from the cross-border of India.\n\n\"",

Nine subprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. The Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model as a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in other high energy consuming provinces. An EPP can be developed at about half the cost of a coal-fired power plant. \n\n\n\nThe outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an efficiency power plant (EPP) to be developed with annual 532 GWh energy savings and an equivalent 107 MW capacity, (ii) development of the energy service sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for promoting and assessing energy efficiency projects, and (iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces, implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of coal, resulting in emission reductions of 415,460 t/y of CO2, 1,785 t/y of total suspended particulates, 4,795 t/y of SO2, and 1,068 t/y of NOx.",

   "Project ID: P114111: The objectives of the Emergency Power Response Project for Central African Republic are to partially restore reliable electricity supply to the project implementing entity's customers in Bangui, including essential service providers such as the Recipient's water company and hospitals, and improve the financial and operational performance of the sector. There are five components to the project. First component of the project is rehabilitation of Boali two hydropower stations. This component will provide for the rehabilitation and the procurement of transformers and protection devices, and the replacement of regulation devices of hydropower turbines. This component will address the lack of protection devices in the substations that put the integrity of the entire network system in jeopardy. Second component of the project is Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) Program. This component will distribute CFLs in order to reduce energy usage for lighting purposes. Third component of the project is pre-payment meters. This component would be a pilot program to introduce pre-payment meters among the main consumer categories, particularly those from whom collection rates are low. The target is to introduce some 5,500 pre-payment meters at customer premises out of about 18,000 customers. Priority would be given to the 5,000 customers who currently have no meters. This would enable Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA) to improve its cash flow, in order to start maintaining its infrastructure. Fourth component of the project is loss reduction program. This component will focus on replacing these old low-voltage distribution lines in six Bangui neighborhoods with PVC insulated aluminum cables, where technical losses are lower and theft of electricity is much more difficult, and on equipping existing and new transformers to improve the quality of service. Fifth and the final component of the project is Agence d 'Exicution des Travaux d 'Interet Public (AGETIP-CAF). This component is constituted of the fees to be paid for the services of AGETIP-CAF in procurement and financial management of the project on behalf of ENERCA, given the low fiduciary capacity of the latter.",

The Company distills such into useful coal-tar pitch and derivatives, thereby creating useful economic value from a low-value feedstock. During the manufacturing process, the company also produces various industrial oils as by-products that can be further used as feedstock for the production of carbon black, a key input for tire manufacturers. \n\n\n\nGiven strong demand, Himadri is expanding its present coal tar pitch distillation capacity of 169,000 metric tons per annum (mtpa) in India to 400,000 mtpa. Phase I consists of (i) increasing its distillation capacity to 250,00 mtpa, (ii) setting up a 50,000 mtpa carbon black production facility and (iii) constructing an associated 12 mega-watt waste-heat recovery based power plant (together, the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù).\n\n\n\nThe project cost is estimated at $139 million for which IFC may provide an investment of up to $35 million.\n\n\n\nIn addition, IFC is considering providing a Carbon Delivery Guarantee (‚ÄúCDG‚Äù) to enhance the value of approximately 0.5 million Certified Emission Reductions (‚ÄúCERs‚Äù) to be generated from the 12 mega-watt waste-heat recovery based power plant that is being constructed as a part of the project.",

The project will be considered successful if: 1) the transaction is closed and the strategic investor takes over OSSH; and 2) if the new regulatory framework is implemented as agreed for the period of the PRG coverage. The PRG will backstop the Government's debt obligation to a commercial bank that has, on behalf of the Government, paid under a Letter of Credit (L/C) that may be drawn by the privatized OSSH in specified circumstances. This will be the second PRG to be provided in support of a power distribution privatization transaction and this use of the PRG was developed specifically to enhance and facilitate the privatization and concessioning of infrastructure and public service utilities. Access to reliable electricity is a key driver of economic growth and a direct means of reducing poverty because it improves the productivity of households and enhances the delivery of social services.",

The Second Programmatic Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL-2) will build upon the initial implementation of the program. The loan is one of the cornerstones of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY08-11 which fully integrates the Bank's activities for FY08-11 into the Government's ninth development plan. Measures undertaken by the Turkish administration and supported under the program are expected to contribute to sustaining the growth experienced by Turkey since 2002, generating employment, supporting the competitiveness of Turkish industry, and improving the living standards of its people. The program carries several risks. From the macroeconomic side, Turkey faces economic challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. In particular, high external financing needs, mainly in the private sector, make Turkey vulnerable to persisting international illiquidity and capital outflows. While a single-party Government with a strong parliamentary majority creates a favorable environment for reform, some political risks to the program remain, including: (i) continuing domestic political differences; and (ii) geopolitical events in neighboring regions. On the program side, all PEDPL-1 supported reforms have been implemented, and the risk of reversal is low. However, there are sector specific risks: delays in implementation of the remaining envisaged reforms, delays in attracting private investment, slow progress of energy efficiency measures contributing to continuing high electricity demand growth, and external developments that result in the policy actions failing to achieve a significant level of improvement in the electricity supply demand imbalance",

This component will renovate and modernize 640 Mega Watts (MW) of old coal-fired power generation capacity to demonstrate energy efficient rehabilitation approaches. Energy efficient R&M of generation units will go beyond the typical Indian practice, of restoring original generation capacity, life-extension, and improving availability, by also modifying (or replacing) some equipment and systems to enable the unit to operate with higher fuel efficiency. This component will also explore and demonstrate approaches for successful implementation of R&M projects (with a focus on energy efficiency) by addressing barriers, including through early identification and mitigation of risks. Finally, the second component is the technical assistance. The technical assistance component of the project is aimed at providing support in implementation of EE R&M pilots, developing a pipeline of EE R&M interventions, addressing barriers to EE R&M projects and strengthening institutional capacities of implementing agencies for improved operation and maintenance practices.",

Umeme Limited (‚ÄúUmeme‚Äù) is a regulated electricity distribution company in Uganda, supplying over 300,000 customers mainly located in the semi-urban strip from Entebbe through Kampala to Jinja. In March 2005, Umeme was awarded a 20 year concession to manage and operate the assets of Uganda Electricity Distribution Company (UEDCL). The award of the concession was part of Uganda‚Äôs broader privatization of its power sector, which also involved the unbundling of transmission, distribution and generation, and the awarding of concessions for the operation of its existing generation assets. Uganda‚Äôs power sector privatization was fully supported by the World Bank Group, and the Umeme financing structure includes both MIGA insurance and a partial risk guarantee from IDA.\n\n\n\nTo date, Umeme has invested about $44 million in rehabilitating and developing its network, making additional connections, implementing a new customer billing system, and rolling out a customer call center and work management centers. Subject to the Ugandan regulator‚Äôs approval, Umeme intends to spend a further $50 million in the next two years (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù). This investment is a continuation of the existing program, covering renewal of its asset base, loss reduction, network extension, and new connections (in addition to the 93,821 Umeme has already made).\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $50 million, of which $20 million would be funded in the form of an A loan and $5 million in the form of equity or C loan from IFC.

The components of the project include: the project concept was designed to provide an integrated technical and financial analysis of end-use projects to be financed by Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). To avoid lengthy and cumbersome application processes for projects that commercial banks will not be interested in financing, the National Agency for Energy Control (ANME) will work closely with PFIs to prescreen projects for financing. This set-up will also allow the integration of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (FNME) subsidies and other grants and loans from different sources in the financing plan of each project, therefore avoiding that projects do not reach financial close because of lack of one of the components of the financing plan. Technical assistance might be useful to complement lines of credit to provide support to Financial Intermediaries (FIs), Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and developers of sub-projects. However, ANME already has very strong capabilities and resources allowing it to provide the support required to PFIs in the area of business planning and sub-project evaluation. It also already benefits from technical assistance from various sources that aim at supporting skill enhancement or capacity building in matters related to financing of Energy Efficiency (EE) activities. Finally, a strong pipeline of identified sub-projects already exists. Should other sources of financing eventually arise for complementary technical assistance, the latter will mainly focus on: (a) training and capacity building of the commercial banks in the area of energy efficiency and cogeneration; (b) providing support to project developers to assist in the preparatory studies and business development assistance including technical and financial feasibility studies; and (c) support for targeted awareness and training efforts to support pipeline development efforts.",

In improving competitiveness, the DPO program will assist the Government to alleviate private sector and governance constraints. Thus, the DPO series proposes to focus on high impact reforms aimed at public sector modernization and private sector development. Priority reforms need to span both the public and private sectors and focus on the following to unlock growth potential, alleviate the human capital constraint, and reduce corruption: strengthening the business environment through lower business registration and inspection costs; improving corporate governance; modernizing the regulatory framework in telecommunications, mining, and energy; reducing compliance costs through tax and customs reform; and improving efficiency and accountability in public financial management through system reform and strengthening incentives in the civil service.

The incinerator is to provide treatment capacity for 130kt/yr. The units will be designed to co-generate electricity and heat, the latter to be supplied to the existing district heating network of Parma. The district heating network will be extended and expanded as part of the project. The generated heat will also serve to dry the sludge prior to incineration.\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\nThe project‚Äôs economic interest is linked to its contribution to improving the waste management system in the Province of Parma by reducing the amounts of untreated municipal waste sent to landfill, particularly biodegradable material. The project is part of a wider regional waste management plan, designed to further improve minimised waste production, selective waste collection and increasing the share of municipal waste subject to recovery, treatment and recycling.

The objectives of the Additional Financing for the Felou Hydroelectric West African Power Pool (WAPP) Second Adaptable Program Loan (APL2) Projects are to: (i) augment the supply of low cost hydroelectricity from the Senegal River Development Organization (OMVS) power system to the' national utilities of Mali (EDM), Mauritania (SOMELEC) and Senegal (SENELEC); and (ii) develop a nucleus of a well functioning, cooperative, power pooling mechanism for the WAPP Zone B (OMVS) countries of West Africa. The project remains of significant importance to the OMVS member countries and shareholders of Manantali Energy Management Company (SOGEM), because the Felou hydroelectric plant is an important source of least cost power supply for regional OMVS power system. Despite the cost increase, the project remains economically and financially viable. Not completing the project will mean that the OMVS power system will be deprived from a relatively low cost power generating source and it will increase the power supply costs for the three utilities in the OMVS member states. The additional financing will enable the project to fully meet its development objectives and it will also continue to support the institutional strengthening and project management capabilities of SOGEM.

The operation aims to promote energy efficiency within the most vulnerable sector of the Bahamian population through the provision of compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) in low income households and increase the awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency and conservation. The program will also develop a disposal program for CFls.\n\nThe project will: (i) develop and distribute information (e.g. brochures, handouts etc.) on the use and benefits of energy efficiency appliances and lighting e.g. where to use CFLs; what types of CFLs to use; how to safely dispose of CFLs; and use of passive lighting etc.; (ii) conduct community-based seminars on energy efficiency and conservation; and (iii) develop a webpage to disseminate information on energy efficiency and conservation for households. This webpage could be hosted on The Bahamas Environment, Science and Technology Commission‚Äôs (BEST) website. The project will also encompass: (i) the replacement of functioning incandescent bulbs with an equal number of compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) in a sample population of low income households; (ii) the implementation of a disposal program for both incandescent and CFLs. CFLs (rated between 15 and 20 W) will be provided to selected beneficiaries in exchange for an equal number of functioning incandescent light bulbs. The functioning incandescent bulbs will have to be rated between 60 and 100 W. The households will be advised to replace incandescent light bulbs in areas of their houses where lights are typically switched on for a long period of time.

La Muela, located in the province of Valencia, on the Jucar basin, would more than double its capacity (from 636 MW to nearly 1500 MW) with 4 new Francis reversible turbines. San Esteban and San Pedro, both located in the province of Ourense, on the Sil basin, will increase their combined capacity from 296 MW to nearly 500 MW. The investment concerns mainly electromechanical equipment (turbines, generators, transformers, etc) installation, and underground civil works (water intakes, penstock tunnels, turbine caverns, etc.) None of the capacity increases will entail any extension of the dams or any additional flooding.\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\nThe project will expand the cost-effective production of renewable energy from existing hydropower plants, and complement the power output during peak periods and storing, with the use of low-cost off-peak electricity. As such, it is in line with EU renewable energy policies and will support Spain in meeting its commitments with respect to greenhouse gas emissions reductions.",

The Misicuni Multipurpose Project is located in the Department of Cochabamba, and its objective is to supply the central Cochabamba Valley with potable water, irrigation water and electric power generation for the National Interconnected System (NIS). Due to the dry weather conditions, the Cochabamba Valley has historically faced a water supply problem aggravated by the population growth in the region. On the other hand, the country needs to increase its generation capacity preferably from renewable sources. The whole project comprises the construction of a 120-m high rock filled and concrete face dam, a 20km tunnel for water diversion (finalized in 2005 with the financial support from the Government of Italy), a pressurized piping system (from 3.700 to 2.700 meters above sea level) that conveys a controlled water flow from the tunnel to the power plant to be built in the Cochabamba Valley. The dam construction contract ($85 million) has been awarded and the financing is in place. The works for the hydroelectric power plant, including complementary investments such as a substation and a transmission line, estimated in about $114.1 million, will be financed with a loan from the IDB. This part of the program will provide energy to the NIS and will contribute to the financial and economical viability of the whole project. The estimated total cost of the project is $114,100,000.",

The tentative components of the project are: I) LEAT 500Kv of approximately 1220km in length and associated Transformation Stations (ET) of 500/132/33kV; 500/345/33kV and other works; ii) Regional transmission and subtransmission lines for the Norte Grande; and iii) Engineering, Administration and Supervision. This transmission line is one of the projects prioritized by the Federal Transmission Plan in 1998, which has as one of its main objectives transforming the Argentine Electric Network from a radial grid to a stronger net system. In particular, the NOA-NEA lines will connect a hydro-generating (North-East) region to a thermal one (North West), enhancing the reliability of the system. The total cost of this project is $512,500,000.",

Maple Etanol S.R.L. and an affiliate, special purpose vehicles acting as co-borrowers, and their sponsor Maple Energy Plc and The Maple Companies Limited will develop a 35 million gallons/year ethanol distillery in the state of Piura on the northwest coast of Peru. The Companies expect to plant 7,800 hectares of sugarcane on approximately 14,000 hectares of land and produce their own electricity through a 37 Megawatt biomass-based cogeneration facility that will also sell excess electricity to the national grid. Booker Tate Limited, an international operator of sugar plantations, has been contracted by Maple to develop and manage the sugarcane lands, all of which will be harvested mechanically. The Project will source its water needs from the nearby Chira River and use a water-conserving drip irrigation system to be developed and implemented by a supplier. The Companies will operate and manage the Project. The ethanol produced is expected to be sold to the European Union and the United States markets. It will be exported through storage and shipment facilities that will be built near the port of Paita. The Companies will also be positioned to supply ethanol to the Peruvian market when a 7.8% ethanol blend in gasoline becomes mandatory nationwide. The Companies will sign a long-term marketing agreement for all their exported ethanol. The Project will be one of the first large-scale ethanol production facilities in Peru that will aim to integrate local communities in the provision of services and employment. The Project aims to make annual cash transfers to the Regional Government of Piura pursuant to a Land Purchase Agreement that will finance the execution of social development projects. The surplus electricity generated and sold to the national grid aims to help reduce Peru‚Äôs dependence on fossil fuel-fired power plants. Companies and the government expect that the Project‚Äôs adoption of water-conserving drip irrigation technology will encourage the sustainable use of water resources in other agricultural activities in the region. The total cost of this project is $245,500,000.",

To finance its substantial investment plans over the next 7 years, Powergrid needs to raise resources of about $22 billion. Assuming a debt component of 65%, this translates to about $14 billion or $2 billion per annum. With the gradual reduction in availability of sovereign-backed funds, Powergrid will be compelled to expand its borrowing from commercial sources. It may no longer be able to rely exclusively on the rupee bond issue route to finance its long-term capital requirements. It needs to urgently diversify its sources of financing to include other options like global bond issues, borrowings in foreign currency from international institutions, and also resort to off-balance sheet financing like project finance, joint ventures, securitized facilities etc.",

The project follows and complements two previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in the province, which have been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.adb.org/projects/44013-013/main\n\n\n\nADB Project 44013- 01 (2010).\n\n\n\nLarge energy efficiency gains can be attained from the district heating subsector through (i) eliminating inefficient inner city small boilers and replacement with cleaner centralized district heating network; (ii) improving insulation in pipelines; and (iii) installation of demand control district heating systems; and (iv) implementing tariff and energy conservation reforms in buildings. Households connected to the modern district heating network will enjoy a cleaner and greener living environment in addition to a comfortable heating service. Similarly, capture and utilization of CMM will avoid GHG emissions and improve the safety of miners, while the expansion of CMM gas distribution network will reduce direct coal burning, improve energy efficiency, and create a lucrative market for CMM. This will result in reduced energy consumption, air pollution and related health impacts, and provide the poor with clean, convenient and affordable energy.",

Its efforts will rest on four main pillars: security, efficiency, sustainability, and equity. The Program will lay the foundation for this new energy policy by supporting institutional adjustments and interventions to improve coordination in the sector. To the same end, it will also conduct studies and develop energy-matrix projection models based on the four pillars and the various possible scenarios. Activities to be carried out with the PROPEF funds are divided into three components: (i) support for the sector‚Äôs new institutional framework;\n\n(ii) formulation of a new energy sector strategy; and (iii) creation of the Program Executing Unit. The electricity subsector matrix at the end of 2009 was composed of hydroelectric generation (38%) and thermoelectric generation (62%), mainly using open-cycle and combined-cycle natural gas plants (60%), coal-fired plants (26%), and diesel-fired plants (10%).

Project description:  InfraCo has applied for MIGA guarantees of an aggregate amount of up to $127.9 million, for a period of up to 20 years, against the risk of breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe Cape Verde Wind Farm Project comprises the development, construction, ownership, and operation of a wind farm in Cape Verde with approximately 28 MW installed capacity. The project will be one of the largest wind farms to be developed in Africa and a high-profile entry to the African renewable energy sector for potential investors. MIGA‚Äôs guarantee is being requested for ‚Ç¨35 million of non-shareholder loans plus ‚Ç¨17 million of interest and ‚Ç¨23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus ‚Ç¨22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\n\n\nEIB Project: \n\n\n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\n\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\n\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\n\n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to Cabe√≥lica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\n\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, S√£o Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island. Each wind farm will include towers with wind turbines, transformers, a substation, a command centre, an underground transmission line and an access road.",

The total project cost for Phase 1 is approximately $139 million. The investment is for the construction and operation of a 25 megawatt power-generation facility using methane gas extracted from Lake Kivu pursuant to a concession agreement between CG and the government of Rwanda (the Phase 1 Pilot Project). CG has applied for a MIGA guarantee of up to $99 million for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of expropriation, transfer restriction, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe entire project (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves extraction and separation of methane gas from the bottom of Lake Kivu and up to 100 megawatts of power-generation capacity to be implemented in two phases. The Phase 1 Pilot Project will involve gas extraction using a floating barge located approximately 13 kilometers offshore from the city of Kibuye. The extracted gas will be further processed and pumped to the shore for use in a power plant via submerged floating pipeline. Power will be produced by methane powered reciprocating engine generator sets with combined capacity of 25 megawatts, net output. Based on successful implementation of Phase 1, Phase 2 will comprise three additional gas extraction barges and three more power production blocks with 75 megawatt capacity resulting in 100 megawatts of overall power generation.\n\n\n\nThe output will be sold to the Rwandan state-owned utility, Rwanda Electricity Corporation (RECO), formerly known as Electrogaz. Phase 1 output will be connected to the national grid via a new dedicated 11 kV transmission line installed by RECO.  Phase 2 will be connected to the existing 220 kV transmission system via two new transformers to be installed by RECO.",

   "Project ID: P120834: The objective of the Additional Financing for the Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project (EERAP) for Tajikistan is to urgently increase the volume and reliability of the national energy supply, especially in the winter season, by supporting the implementation of the Energy Emergency Management Action Plan (EEMAP). The additional financing of US$15 million equivalent for the EERAP is being prepared in response to a Tajik Government request to International Development Association (IDA) to provide support for meeting severe energy shortages. The EERAP will be restructured with level two restructuring to address changed circumstances and the new challenges such as Tajikistan's cut off from Central Asia Power System (CAPS) and consequent needs to increase domestic power generation. The EERAP aims to: (a) ensure basic access to electricity for about 250,000 people in northern Tajikistan, and (b) increase heat and power supply to the entire country, without overdrawing or depleting hydro resources in winter. The additional financing will help finance costs associated with the following original project's activities: (i) scale-up of project activities to provide critically needed power; and (ii) a corresponding scale-up of project management support. A scale-up of the EERAP is appropriate because it supports project development objectives and aligns with the 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n\n\n\nIn response to the 2007-08 crisis, the Government developed the Energy Emergency Mitigation Action Plan (EEMAP); its objectives were to (a) sustain thermal and heat energy \n\nsupply in the shortest possible timeframe; (b) initiate preparations for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 winters, when energy supply remained in deficit; and (c) identify medium- and long-term actions to be implemented to improve energy security. The Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance \n\nProject (EERAP) helped implement elements of EEMAP, which is now almost complete, and has met its objectives. However, Government is revising EEMAP. Suggested measures include: (a) rapid construction of transmission lines to link areas unconnected to the Tajik energy grid; (b) procure more power from IPPs, such as Sangtuda-1; (c) improve Nurek hydro reservoir management; (d) enhance efforts to reduce \n\nlosses, and (e) improve demand-side management by using more energy-saving technologies.

   "August 10, 2010 \n\n1. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC, President & CEO: Hiroshi Watanabe)*1 signed on August 9 a \n\nbuyer's credit*2 agreement in the amount of up to 900 million US dollars with the EGYPTIAN REFINING COMPANY \n\n(TAKRIR) S.A.E. (ERC), a company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt, provided under project financing*3. \n\nThis loan was cofinanced with the following commercial banks: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (the Facility \n\nAgent); Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Tokyo Branch; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Tokyo Branch; \n\nStandard Chartered Bank Tokyo Branch, ; Cr√©dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Tokyo Branch and The \n\nSumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd., with the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing Buyer's \n\nCredit Insurance for the cofinanced portion. Besides this loan, the project has also been financed by other export \n\ncredit agencies and multilateral institutions, namely the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the European Investment Bank \n\nand the African Development  Bank. This is the first project finance loan that JBIC has provided to a project in the \n\nArab Republic of Egypt. \n\n \n\n2. In this Project, ERC, in which Citadel Capital S.A.E., an Egyptian investment company, and the Egyptian General \n\nPetroleum Corporation (EGPC) have equity stakes, will construct, own and operate processing units to refine \n\natmospheric residue to be fed from EGPC's existing Cairo Refinery, and will then sell diesel and other refined \n\nproducts to EGPC over the long-term. JBIC is financing ERC to construct the new processing units, the EPC \n\ncontractor for which is a joint venture which includes Mitsui & Co., Ltd., thereby supporting the export of Japanese \n\nplant facilities and machinery.  \n\n \n\n3. With many of its existing refineries equipped with simple and outdated distillation units, Egypt, an exporter of surplus \n\nfuel oil, is unable to meet domestic demand for middle distillates such as diesel and relies on imports for such \n\nproducts. The Project is aimed at substituting such imports with domestic production by installing advanced \n\nprocessing facilities. Additionally, the Project is expected to contribute to environmental improvement, as the \n\nproduction of high-quality refined products with the state-of-the-art facilities to be installed will reduce emissions of \n\nsuch air pollutants as NOx and SOx. \n\n \n\n4. During the fourth meeting of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in May 2008, the \n\ngovernment of Japan pledged to offer some 2.5 billion US dollars in financial support to Africa over a 5-year period \n\nthrough JBIC operations.  This loan, which supports Japanese firms' exports to Africa, is well aligned with this \n\ngovernment policy.   \n\n \n\n5. When the Project was forced to reconsider its financing plan due to the credit squeeze in the aftermath of the \n\nfinancial crisis in 2008, JBIC decided to participate in this Project and helped structure effective financing in \n\ncollaboration with other public financial institutions, while drawing on its abundant experience in project finance.  To \n\ncreate export opportunities for Japanese industries, JBIC will continue its support for Japanese overseas business \n\nactivities by drawing on its expertise, risk-assuming function and wide range of financial instruments. \n\n\n\nMay 6, 2010 IFC project# 29128: The project consists of the construction of a 5 million ton per annum hydro-cracking and coking facility in Mostorod, Greater Cairo, by the Egyptian Refining Company SAE (‚ÄúERC‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) to upgrade locally available refinery atmospheric residue into lighter products, such as ultra low sulfur Euro V diesel and high octane gasoline blending component, for the domestic Egyptian market (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù). The Project will also include environmental upgrades to the adjoining facilities of state-owned Cairo Oil Refining Company (‚ÄúCORC‚Äù) and Petroleum Pipeline Company (‚ÄúPPC‚Äù). \n\nEgyptian General Petroleum Company (‚ÄúEGPC‚Äù), a Government of Egypt (‚ÄúGOE‚Äù) economic authority, and owner of both CORC and PPC, will supply most of the feedstock to the Project and off-take most of its production. The Project is seen by GOE as an important import substitution project which will address the strong deficit of lighter petroleum products in the Greater Cairo region, which represents about half of the Egyptian refined products market, and Egypt‚Äôs surplus of atmospheric residue/fuel oil.",

   "MIGA Project 8092. Project description:  InfraCo has applied for MIGA guarantees of an aggregate amount of up to $127.9 million, for a period of up to 20 years, against the risk of breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe Cape Verde Wind Farm Project comprises the development, construction, ownership, and operation of a wind farm in Cape Verde with approximately 28 MW installed capacity. The project will be one of the largest wind farms to be developed in Africa and a high-profile entry to the African renewable energy sector for potential investors. MIGA‚Äôs guarantee is being requested for ‚Ç¨35 million of non-shareholder loans plus ‚Ç¨17 million of interest and ‚Ç¨23 million of shareholder loans (or equity) plus ‚Ç¨22 million of interests (or earnings, in case that equity were to be guaranteed).\n\n\n\nEIB Project: \n\n\n\nThe project comprises the development, construction and operation of four onshore wind farms and all interconnections from the wind farms to the local 20 kV grid connection points and associated transmission infrastructure on the islands of Santiago (9.65 MW), Boa Vista (4.25 MW), Sal (7.65 MW) and Sao Vicente (5.95 MW) in Cape Verde. The wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 27.2 MW.\n\n\n\nThe project satisfies European Union and Bank policy objectives to encourage renewable energy generation and address the impacts on climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. It further falls under the scope of the environmental and economic development goals of the Cotonou Mandate. Indeed, by providing electricity from a renewable energy source at an affordable, economic cost, the project addresses two key objectives of the Bank's external lending mandate: environmental protection and improvement and security of energy supply. It furthermore supports private investments in a project of public interest.\n\n\n\nAfrican Development Bank: \n\n\n\nThe Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, through its private sector window, approved on Wednesday, 19 May 2010 in Tunis a senior loan of EUR 15 million to Cabe√≥lica wind power project in Cape Verde.\n\n\n\nThe project consists in the construction, operation and maintenance of four onshore wind farms on four islands of the Cape Verdean archipelago (Santiago, S√£o Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista). These will have a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW and will be connected to the existing electricity grid on each island. Each wind farm will include towers with wind turbines, transformers, a substation, a command centre, an underground transmission line and an access road.",

The additional financing will help support the costs associated with scaled-up activities to enhance the impact of a well-performing original project, allowing for: (i) further expansion of electricity access in low income underserved neighborhoods of Djibouti Ville; and (ii) efficiency improvements for EDD by reducing losses in electricity distribution. The additional financing provides both continuity (building up on the original project's previous successful power access efforts) and innovation (efficiency and governance issues are supported by focusing on loss reduction, in a context where improving EDD's financial performance is essential). The additional financing does not propose to pursue the diversification of generation agenda for two reasons: (i) private sector interest in wind, solar, and geothermal investments exists and can better be supported through other avenues (the Bank is already engaged with the Government of Djibouti in a dialogue on how best to mobilize investments for geothermal development); and (ii) EDD's current level of electricity losses will offset the bulk of benefits that could be obtained today from small scale diversification.

   "Project ID: P118610 The objective of the Project Preparation Technical Assistance (TA) Facility Project for Vietnam is to increase the capacity of Government entities to plan and prepare public investments efficiently and to international quality standards. There are three components to the project, the first component being project preparation facility. The project will finance the preparation of a large number of sub-projects over a five-year implementation period. These range from large-scale infrastructure investments, requiring preparation budgets of up to US$20 million, to smaller scale social sector operations, requiring individual consultant inputs costing around US$0.5 million or less. The scope of this component will include all tasks required to complete the preparation of the selected subprojects so that their implementation can commence as soon as investment financing is available. The second component is the project preparation facility support and capacity building. This component provides support to Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), the project's executing agency to assist it with project implementation, and also for capacity building targeting Implementing Agencies (IAs), and broader policy dialogue and studies to improve the government's overall development program and project performance. Finally, the third component is the incremental operating costs and project management expenses.\tEnergy and mining (General energy sector) (15%)",

   "IDB project HA-T113. Before the earthquake of January 2010, the energy sector in Haiti had a number of weaknesses and existed in a state of crisis which directly affected the economic activity and living standards of the Haitian population. These weaknesses include: (i) dependence on fossil fuels for primary electricity generation; (ii) limited availability and access to electricity; (iii) significant technical and commercial energy losses; and (iv) dependence on fuel wood and charcoal, mainly used for cooking, which causes deforestation. The earthquake has exacerbated this situation and created an urgent need for a long term energy strategy that integrates short term reconstruction measures with long term goals. In 2007 the Ministry of Public Works Transport and Telecommunications, with the technical assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, produced the Haiti National Energy Sector Development Plan (NESDP). The NESDP included a comprehensive diagnosis of Haiti's energy sector in 2007, identified the key issues that needed to be addressed and proposed actions for the development of the energy sector from 2007 to 2017. This study will be taken as a starting point for the development of an energy strategy, however, it must be reassessed, reformulated and expanded, in order to take into account the impacts of the earthquake on Haiti's energy sector. Such impacts include key issues like migration to the urban areas, the shift of demand centers due to migration patterns, the reconstruction of housing infrastructure, and the opportunities offered by new technologies that can be employed in the energy sector.Consequently, the objective of this KCP is to help the Government of Haiti identify and develop a comprehensive strategy for the energy sector. This strategy will consider not only the immediate and short term measures that need to be taken to rebuild the energy sector after the earthquake, but also the medium and long term actions and reforms that could lead Haiti's energy sector toward a more efficient and sustainable system that is commercially viable, has a more diverse energy matrix and a greater service coverage. The total cost of this project is $100,000.",

   "IDB project NI-L1057. PENSA, a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Nicaragua, and its majority shareholder, are seeking financing for the second phase of the development of the San Jacinto-Tizate geothermal resource near the municipality of Le√≥n, Nicaragua. PENSA is currently operating a 10 megawatt (MW) geothermal back-pressure power plant (the ‚ÄúB/P Unit‚Äù), and will expand generation capacity in two, 36 MW phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Upon completion of Phase 2, the 10 MW B/P Unit will be decommissioned, unless otherwise allowed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). Phase 1 of the expansion is currently underway, involving construction of the powerhouse and installation of a 38.8 MW (gross) Fuji steam turbine at a cost of $152.2 million. Phase 2 consists of the drilling of additional production and injection wells, the building of steamfield infrastructure, and installation of an identical 38.8 MW turbine at a total cost of $177 million, including $20 million allocated for cost overruns, as required by the Phase 2 lenders. The IDB senior loan to PENSA and SJPIC, as co-Borrowers, will partially finance the Project, which will be co-financed by a group of multilateral lenders and development finance institutions. Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be operated as one integrated project. PENSA has a 20-year PPA with DISNORTE and DISSUR, the local, privatized power distributors owned by Uni√≥n Fenosa. Upon completion of Phase 2 of the Project, PENSA will operate a net 72 MW base-load plant that will be among the lowest marginal cost producers in Nicaragua. The Project will increase Nicaragua‚Äôs overall power generation capacity, and will represent approximately 8% of the Country‚Äôs total installed capacity. The total cost of this project is $216,000,000.",

The grant is a single-tranche operation supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake. First, the operation supports the implementation of the Government Action Plan for National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the international community in March 2010, aimed at rebuilding the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on decentralization presents economic and social reforms as well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports the government's program for enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction process. The Government Action Plan and governance program are in line with the strategy contained in the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for the period 2008-2010, of which one pillar aims at strengthening state capacity and management of public resources.

The Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) will cover US$15 million out of the total credit amount. This is the fifth and the last credit in a series of five annual programmatic PRSC operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the implementation of Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005- 2010. As the last operation in the series, this PRSC-8 is a bridge between the current and the next series of PRSCs, which would start with the planned PRSC-9. Against the country context of the weaker-than-expected poverty reduction over the past seven years, as well as the negative impact of the global financial crisis, the specific objectives of this operation are to: (i) complete and consolidate reform achievements under the current PRSC series to move toward the stated medium-term objectives of the series; and (ii) strategically lay the ground for the next series based on medium-term goals. The trends in poverty reduction are described in section two of this report, and the implications in terms of program design for PRSC- 8, notably an increased focus on income generation and rural areas, are discussed in section five. The impact of the global financial crisis on Tanzania is discussed in 'recent economic developments' in section two, and the Bank's responses are discussed in \"operation description\" in section five. The progress on the government program supported by PRSC and on the broader policy spectrum are described in section five under 'summary assessment of overall progress' and 'description of policy areas.'

The objectives of the Energy Sector Development Policy Operation Program are to contribute to reducing Tonga's fiscal deficit and to support the Government's efforts in implementing reforms in the energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and stable growth in the medium term. The program will provide budget support to reduce the near-term fiscal deficit. It will also reinforce the importance of implementation of energy sector reforms necessary to reduce Tonga's vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks, which otherwise will pose a significant risk to achieving stable growth in the medium term. Like other Pacific Island nations, Tonga is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and to external economic shocks because of its small size combined with a large distance from the nearest large market. The knock-on effects of the global economic crisis, in particular in remittances and tourism revenues, contributed to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contractions of 0.4 percent in FY2008-09 and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009-10. As the government recognized the extent to which its tax revenues had been affected by the global economic crisis last year, it took emergency measures to limit recurrent expenditures including imposing lower ceilings on the expenditures in most ministries toward the end of FY2009-2010. It also sought budget support in the form of grants from donors. While the outlook is for growth to recover in FY2010-2011 to around 1.5 to 2 percent, downside risks remain. Containing expenditure to the level set in the budget will be challenging, even with greater attention to expenditure prioritization, given the emergency-nature of the budget cuts already instituted in FY2009-10.

The TA will also increase the capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) to a level at which MEW can analyze the country's power sector needs without the help of a third party. A Power Sector Master Plan would include the following: (i) Major load centers identified, including forecast of growth levels over next 20 years, (ii) Generation strategy considering both indigenous and foreign power supply sources, (iii) Transmission network development plan for interconnecting generation facilities and load centers\n\nMEW staff trained to update the master plan from time to time and keep it relevant \n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 43497-013.\n\n\n\nThe Policy and Advisory Technical Assistance (PATA) supported Afghanistan in preparing its Power Sector Master Plan (the Master Plan) whereby (i) a 20-year demand forecast was produced, (ii) generation and import supply options were analyzed and optimized, (iii) a transmission network was designed to link supply to demand, and (iv) a 10-year investment plan was prepared. A consulting firm, Fichtner GmbH & Co. KG (Germany), was selected as the PATA consultant in October 2011 using quality- and cost-based selection method. In April 2013, the consultant presented the final report to the government and a wide selection of stakeholders in Kabul. The report was approved by the Ministry of Energy and Water, the executing agency. The consultant completed its assignment in May 2013 with an excellent performance evaluation rating.

The Kribi project will be Cameroon's second Independent Power Project (IPP) after the Dibamba power plant.  The Kribi plant site will be located near Mpolongwe village, 9 km northeast of the coastal city of Kribi in the Southern Region of Cameroon. The new 100km 225kV double circuit transmission line will run between Kribi step up substation at the plant site and the existing Mangombe 225/90kV substation at Ed√©a in the Littoral Region. The plant site is located at about 12 km from the offshore Sanaga Sud gas field, and 18 km from the gas Central Processing Facility to be built by SNH/Perenco at Bipaga, which will supply gas for the plant‚Äôs operation. The expected project cost is approximately Euros 255 million to be financed on a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.

All energy that would be produced by the Project would be sold to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (‚ÄúNTDC‚Äù) under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement, backed by a GOP Guarantee. An Implementation Agreement would be signed prior to financial close that would entail the GOP‚Äôs support for the project and would also lay out the rights and obligations of all parties.\n\n\n\nThe proposed expansion will be structured as a standalone Independent Power Plant (‚ÄúIPP‚Äù) and will be built on the site of the first plant, utilizing the available vacant land, and will use some of the existing physical and management infrastructure. The project will use the indigenous gas that is available in the UGF and is being used by the first plant. In addition to the infrastructure, the project will operate with the existing plant in the form of a shared management team as well as common utilization of O&M resources and administrative staff. The synergies are expected to result in a shorter construction period as well as reduced overall project costs, which would result in a more competitive tariff for the project. Similar to the operating 586 MW Uch-I plant, the new plant  is expected to be a low-cost producer of power in the country and would be in line with IFC‚Äôs strategy to support the development of low cost thermal power and help improve sector operating costs.\n\n\n\nThe Project will be established under a separate project company, called Uch-II Power (Private Limited), which will be established in Islamabad and will be 100% owned by IP. Headquartered in London, IP is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has regional offices in Boston, Singapore, Melbourne and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at US $500 million. \n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment is an A-loan for IFC‚Äôs own account of up to US $100 million.",

   "IBRD/IDA Project ID: P121812. The objective of the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC VI) for Cape Verde is to support the policy reforms and institutional development necessary to foster sustained economic growth. The Government of Cape Verde (GOCV) has made considerable progress in achieving its reform objectives under both the current and previous PRSC series and has completed all PRSC benchmarks. Additionally, the government has met all assessment criteria for the final review of its International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Cape Verde has built a solid reputation for good governance and responsible fiscal policy: it ranks first in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the Africa Region (Low Income Countries). From 2000 to 2008 the Cape Verdean economy enjoyed an average annual real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5 percent. In 2007 Cape Verde graduated to Middle-Income Country (MIC) status. According to the analysis that underpins the proposed PRSC VI; fiscal deficits are expected to remain high through 2012. These are largely the joint result of adverse external conditions and the temporary acceleration of public investment which reflects the strategy to take advantage of the five-year window under which the government can still tap concessional sources of financing, following Cape Verde's graduation to MIC status. As the global economy, and the Euro Zone in particular, recovers from its current recession, the Cape Verdean economy should return to a robust growth path, and, in this context, the government's long-term macroeconomic stance remains adequate. The current PRSC VI will enable the government to maintain fiscal sustainability and continue its investment program without curtailing social services or accumulating an unsustainable debt burden.

Activities: community meetings, discussions, and interviews, consumer education campaign to involve women's groups, and women leaders in business and government \n\n\n\nABD Project 41340-014.\n\n\n\n1. Following the progress of Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing on Advanced Electricity Metering Project, this phase 2 project will replicate and expand the advanced electricity metering (AEM) system that uses modern, accurate, and theft-proof revenue meters for the power grid system and the end-user in five new regions (Andijan, Ferghana, Kashkadarya, Namangan, and Surkhandarya). The project will help improve energy efficiency in the power distribution sector, by reducing commercial losses and improving the efficiency of electricity revenue collection. The project will include installation of 2.6 million meters and meter data management (MDM) system that includes billing and energy data management, and capacity development for operational improvement in reducing commercial losses. 2. The economy has sustained high growth, averaging 8.5% since 2006. Growth in 2013 and beyond is expected to remain at 7.5-9%. The Government of Uzbekistan (the government) prioritizes modernizing industry and developing infrastructure and the private sector. Reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to achieving these goals. One of the key challenges is the high level of commercial losses in the power sector. The state joint stock company Uzbekenergo, a vertically integrated utility fully owned by the government, estimates losses of 7.2% in transmission and 12.6% in distribution in 2011 (national average). Distribution losses in the targeted five regions ranged between 10.4% and 27.6% in 2011. 3. The high level of commercial losses is caused by the lack of investment in modernizing the distribution assets together with outdated manual operation that results in inaccurate, unreliable and inefficient revenue collection. Electricity meters are generally old, inaccurate, and susceptible to tampering, but still in service beyond their designed economic life without proper recalibration. Without proper grid metering, Uzbekenergo faces difficulty in accounting for electricity use or identifying electricity tampered. Manual-based tariff collection operation and billing system are subject to inaccurate, inefficient, and ineffective accounting of revenue collection. Current incentive mechanism to reduce commercial losses is not sufficiently institutionalized. 4. To overcome these challenges, Uzbekenergo has requested international financial institutions (IFIs) with ADB as the lead development partner to help implement and finance a nationwide AEM program. AEM, or smart metering with digital meters, allows two-way communication between the utility and consumers. AEM enables the utility to remotely monitor and disconnect supply without sending reading personnel to the site. It provides consumers with power usage information more frequently. AEM can also help identify losses, reduce commercial losses, and improve tariff collection. 5. Uzbekenergo aims at gradually covering all 5.8 million customers across the country. It has initiated its first large-scale AEM project financed by ADB, covering 1 million customers. The implementation consultant has been recruited, bidding has been launched, and prebid meeting was successfully held with participations from more than 20 firms. The contract award is expected by the end of 2013. Based on the smooth implementation of the phase 1 project, Uzbekenergo has requested ADB to finance the second phase project covering five regions. 6. The project follows ADB s strategy for Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply. The project is included in Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan 2012 2014.",

   "IFC Project Number 29681: Sunborne Energy LLC (‚ÄúSunborne‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) was set up in 2008 by a team of professionals, with the backing of General Catalyst Partners and Khosla Ventures, to develop and operate solar power projects in India, mainly using solar thermal or CSP technology. \n\n\n\nWithin CSP technologies, Sunborne plans to use parabolic trough technology for its initial greenfield projects targeted in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, which are conceived to be developed under state Government and Central Government schemes, as applicable.\n\n\n\nAt present the Company has one greenfield 15 MW Photo Voltaic (PV) project under development in Gujarat and is following National Solar Mission (a central government program) procedures for securing allocation of additional solar power projects. \n\n\n\nIt plans to have 700 MW of operating solar power generation capacity by 2017. Sunborne already has a strong team in place and also plans to develop crucial in-house EPC capability for executing solar thermal projects in future.\n\n\n\nThe company's first few proposed projects are expected to be developed in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The proposed sites are in district Kutch in western Gujarat, in the North West corner of Andhra Pradesh near Gattu village and in the Thar desert in Phalodi in the Jodhpur District of Rajasthan. The sites are well placed for solar power generation with adequate solar resource. The sites for the solar thermal project have also access to water resources and nearby grid substations.\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at about US$230 million of which US$70 million is estimated as Project equity and US$160 million as long term debt, assuming Sunborne is able to develop and finance one 15 MW PV project and one 50 MW CSP project in the next 12 months.\n\n\n\nSunborne is raising a total of US$24.8 million at present, partly as equity (US$18.9 million) and partly as Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (US$5.9 million), to fund project development activities for its first few projects.\n\n\n\nIFC is proposing to participate in this through an investment of US$4.1 million in equity and US$5.9 million in quasi-equity instruments for its own account. This is proposed to provide partial funding for the equity requirement for the first few projects to be executed by Sunborne.",

Market penetration rates of specific eligible  techniques are close to zero and REECL financing will help to expand the market of technologies and associated services;\n\nDemonstration of intermediation with associations of apartment owners - refurbishments by associations can have a more comprehensive and larger scale impact on energy efficiency and emissions savings. However, Bulgarian banks are not yet confident and do not have experience with structuring lending to these newly established housing associations, that evidently lack credit history. The introduction of a loss risk cover mechanism and other incentives under the facility will help promote lending to associations of apartment owners and this targeted lending will help demonstrate the association‚Äôs viability as market participants. This will have a strong demonstration effect and may encourage other transactions in the area of energy efficiency with housing associations, or even in other sectors.",

That is, commercially oriented service delivery of energy and ICTs, and small-scale renewable energy power generation by private enterprises, which can effectively support scale-up of electricity and ICT access to underserved areas on a sustainable basis. Rural electrification is a new field for the private sector in Uganda. The country has lacked the capacities and institutional framework for the type of commercially oriented rural and renewable energy development envisaged.

   "This operation contributes to the strategic outcomes of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) by focusing support on two Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs: growth for jobs and exports, and governance. It adopts policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support, Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support continued reforms in health and the implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature partnership between international partners and Rwanda. Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been implemented since 2008. In 2010 Rwanda continued its strong reform performance, despite the impact of the recent global economic slowdown.  (General energy sector 21%).",

   "The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) has approved the largest financing transaction in its 75-year history -- $3 billion to support U.S. exports for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea. Workers at over 55 U.S. companies will provide goods and services for the project.\n\n\n\nEx-Im Bank, the official export credit agency of the United States (ECA), five other ECAs and 17 commercial banks will provide financing for the project. Total project costs are estimated to be $18.3 billion.\n\n\n\nThe project has the potential to double the gross domestic product of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\n\"Our approval of this project is yet another demonstration of how Ex-Im Bank is achieving its mission to provide financing for U.S. exports, and supporting U.S. export-related jobs, by supplementing what commercial lenders are able or willing to provide\" said Ex-Im Bank Chairman and President Fred P. Hochberg.\n\n\n\nThe ECAs and commercial lenders involved in financing the project conducted extensive research into the potential impacts of the project. The resulting study found that the production and export of LNG from this project will represent a net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions compared to the case where customers were to meet their energy requirements by coal, fuel oil or diesel commonly used in the regional market, even though the project will add to Papua New Guinea's total emissions of greenhouse gasses.\n\n\n\nAt the ceremony announcing the investment, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare said, \"ExxonMobil and our other private sector development partners have shown significant confidence in our nation. Cooperation between the public and private sectors will create value for the Papua New Guinea society as a whole and grow our economy in the future.\"\n\n\n\nThe project will involve development of upstream natural gas fields, a 692-kilometer onshore and offshore pipeline, a 6.3 million metric-tons-per-year liquefaction plant near Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, and marine facilities from which the LNG will be shipped to foreign buyers. The project will sell the LNG in the large Asia-Pacific market.\n\n\n\n43197-012: The proposed Port Moresby Grid Development Project (Project) will upgrade and extend the transmission and distribution grid in the national capital, Port Moresby, thereby improving the reliability and quality of power supply to the main urban center in Papua New Guinea (PNG), improving the energy efficiency of power delivery, and enabling delivery of essential power to rapidly expanding areas of Port Moresby.

The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period 2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform program and maximizing the impact of its poverty reduction strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for ongoing policy dialogue with the government and other major stakeholders; it promotes coordination between the government and the donor community and complements the continuing efforts of other cooperating partners. As a result, economic growth has not generated the expanded employment opportunities and increased income necessary for further poverty reduction. Zambia must successfully diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor sectors if the country is to make significant progress in achieving its poverty reduction goals. (Power 25%).",

The financial support granted to Togo would help implement the country‚Äôs economic reform agenda, and would further narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key elements of the country‚Äôs poverty reduction strategy and resources available from the Government‚Äôs own revenues and other donor support. The World Bank‚Äôs Board of Directors today approved a grant amounting to US$28 million for the Republic of Togo to support the implementation of the Fourth Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-4).  This operation aims to support the implementation of economic governance reforms initiated under previous economic recovery operations granted respectively in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Most specifically, the ERGG-4 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial management and governance of key sectors of the economy. In this regard, the new operation would put an emphasis on two main pillars i.e.: (i) the strengthening of governance with the aim of improving budget formulation, execution and controls, and public procurement; and (ii) the consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth including through reforms in the phosphate, cotton and energy sectors. The reforms supported by the new operation are critical to the Government‚Äôs ability to use public resources efficiently and effectively to support the country‚Äôs economic and social recovery.  The approval of ERGG-4 is based on a set of prior actions in the following areas: (1) Public financial management: (i) preparation of draft decrees and laws to implement the six West African Economic Monetary Union directives pertaining to public finances; (ii) publication of the 2010 quarterly budget execution reports and submission to Parliament, of the draft 2011 budget law with a medium-term expenditure framework for each of the education, health and agriculture sectors; (iii) adoption of a  treasury management planning order; (iv) submission by the SOTOCO‚Äôs  liquidator, CEET SNPT and Togo T√©l√©com of their respective 2007 and 2008 financial statements to the Court of Accounts; and (v) development and operation of the procurement website, and publication and circulation of the Procurement Newspaper. (2) Cotton sector: (i) the implementation of an analytical accounting system for new cotton company NSCT which is consistent with the recommendations of the Assessment Report; and (ii) the provision of training to farmer leaders toward a better participation within the NSCT board.  The objectives are to improve the financial management of NSCT, and to strengthen farmers‚Äô representational abilities on the Board of NSCT to ensure their participation in the decision-making process. (3) Phophate sector: adoption of a detailed action plan and budget for the activities that are to be implemented under EITI-Togo; the objective is to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability, thus contributing to greater private sector and donor confidence.\n\n(4) Energy sector: adoption of the Utility Tariffs Adjustment Order. This prior action will contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of CEET as it passes-through to the consumers the tariff adjustment that CEB made in June 2009.\n\nUpon approval of the project, Madani M. Tall, Country Director for Togo, commended the Togolese government for all the efforts made to implement the prior actions for the new budget support operation, These efforts have led to the consolidation of reforms initiated in 2008 with our first budget support operation.  We strongly believe that the ERGG-4 will help continue the implementation of the country‚Äôs reform agenda to support the economic and social recovery, and help address the institutional and economic challenges‚Äù. Tall also commended government for efforts made to achieved the HIPC Completion point, and encourage them to pursue and intensify the reforms already started, in order to fully enjoy the benefits of the debt relief, i.e. having more facility to mobilize the resources necessary to achieve growth and reduce poverty. The program is aligned with the World Bank Interim Strategy for Togo, and also with Togo‚Äôs poverty reduction strategy.  It is closely coordinated with other World Bank programs for Togo, and with the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs ECF program. The Togolese Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for implementing the grant, which will be released in a single tranche.  (Power 20%).",

This program document proposes a fifth PRSC for the Republic of Mali in the amount of SDR 44.5 million (US$70 million equivalent). This operation is the third in a programmatic series of three PRSCs designed to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Specifically, this second series aims to strengthen public financial management and improve access to basic social services, while enhancing the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private investment. The reform program supported by this operation continues and deepens the agenda introduced by third PRSC and fourth PRSC, with an increased focus on improving the environment for private investment and infrastructure. The design of the second PRSC series benefited from consultations with various stakeholders. The lessons learned from the implementation of the first four PRSCs were taken into account in the design of this follow-up operation.",

Nepal‚Äôs total grid-connected generation capacity amounts to a meager 698 MW (with actual available capacity at any moment considerably less) and, with a peak demand of about 885 MW, the supply-demand gap has grown sharply in recent years. Load-shedding (rationing of\n\nelectricity to grid-connected consumers) has long been a facet of the hydro-dependent power system in Nepal, where protracted conflict and weak institutions and finances have discouraged investment and hampered the addition of generation capacity. Moreover, the Nepal power Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized system lacks adequate storage to capture the wet season surplus water that could be used to boost generation in the dry season. The objectives of Kabeli Transmission Project are: to support the addition of transmission capacity to the Integrated Nepal Power System; and to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to communities in the area of the Kabeli 132 kV transmission line. This project has 3 components. Component 1 will construct a new 132 kV transmission line in eastern Nepal, with associated technical assistance. Component 2 will install distribution lines and associated infrastructure to provide access to electricity to communities in the area of the transmission line, with associated technical assistance. Component 3 will provide access to electricity and cooking fuel through off-grid schemes in communities for which grid extension (Component 2) is not a feasible option, with associated technical assistance.

   "IFC Project 31383.  \n\n\n\nThe project consists in the development, construction and operation of a 305.5 MW hydropower generation plant (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù) in the Reventaz√≥n river basin located in Siquirres, province of Lim√≥n, Costa Rica. The construction process has started and the Project is expected to start operations in 2016. \n\n\n\nThe Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh annually, on average, once operational; representing around 10% of the energy expected to be produced in Costa Rica by then.  The Project will be developed through a special purpose vehicle (Fideicomiso Reventaz√≥n or the ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù, a Costa Rican trust). The Trust is expected to lease the Project to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (‚ÄúICE‚Äù) when operational. The Project is expected to have high economic and developmental impact in the following ways: 1) provision of critical infrastructure to support economic growth: the Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh of base-load power generation annually, or about 10% of the country's total generation, helping to meet increasing power demand driven by economic growth; 2) decreasing carbon emissions through the displacement of fossil-fuel powered generation. \n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment consists in a US$100 million A Loan. The remaining debt financing for the Project is expected to be provided by the Interamerican Development Bank (‚ÄúIDB‚Äù) and a group of international institutional investors.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1056.\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a 305.5 MW hydroelectric plant and its associated facilities including transmission lines, substations and access roads to be located in the Province of Limon, located at 8 kilometers southeast of the city of Siquirres in Costa Rica.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1049.\n\n\n\nICE and the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica, have requested to the IDB a Second Operation under the CCLIP CR-X1005, to finance investments for the Reventaz√≥n Hydroelectric Project (RHP).The Operation is consistent with the objective of the CCLIP CR-X1005 and is included in the Borrower's investment plan for the electricity sector.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1086.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this TC (technical cooperation grant) is provide technical assistance in the development and implementation of the strategy adopted to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of the PHR, in particular measures envisaged to maintain biological connectivity corridor habitat biodiversity caused by the new reservoir, well, development of best practices in social and environmental assessment related to environmental compensation.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1074. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this ordinary capital is to complete the environmental studies necessary for the financing of the Reventazon Hydroelectric Project (PHR). The 306-MW hydro project is planned for the area of Siquirres in Limon province and would use water from the Reventazon, and supply 524,000 homes. Project works include a 130-meter-high, 527-meter-wide concrete face rockfill dam, a 1.68-kilometer water transport tunnel and four Francis turbines. The PHR will increase power generation available to the Regional Electricity Market, to be sell through the transmission line that is part of SIEPAC.

   "IBRD/IDA Project Id P125374. The Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank approved on Tuesday a $2.2 million grant to support the water and energy sectors in Guinea-Bissau. This additional grant will complement the Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project grant of US$12.7 million approved in July 2010, and will enable the purchase of a five megawatt (MW) thermal power generator.  ‚ÄúThis additional financing is important because it will enable the city of Bissau to double electricity supply from the public utility company, Water and Electricity of Guinea Bissau, thus improving the reliability of clean water supply and the business climate‚Äù, said Moez Cherif, Senior Energy Economist and World Bank Task Team Leader of the project.  Guinea-Bissau is facing structural deficit in electricity generation and distribution. It is currently generating about 4 MW of power on a regular basis, while the unrestricted demand for power in Bissau has been estimated at about 30 MW. ‚ÄúThe Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation project is only the first step toward larger investments and reforms of the electricity and water sectors. Other donors are also contributing to this effort‚Äù, Moez Cherif added.\n\nBecause of the failure of public electricity supply, there is an estimated 20 MW of private capacity installed by large consumers such as embassies, international organizations, hotels and other institutions, and around 1,000 small generators used in the residential sector. ‚ÄúThis is costly to the fragile economy of Guinea-Bissau in terms of competitiveness and has a negative environmental impact as small diesel generators are more costly and less energy efficient than larger utility-run plants‚Äù, said Cherif.",

Enhanced capacity for application of environmental and social safeguards standards 5. Enhanced efficiency of IDCOL in developing and financing infrastructure subprojects\n\n\n\n(iii) promote renewable energy systems (RESs) by financing the set-up of RES such as solar home system (SHS) and other renewable energy applications such as biomass and gas installations (component C). One of the main aspects of Component C is to help provide access to environment-friendly electricity for rural population in off-grid areas by financing the set-up of RESs such as SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program, and biomass and gas installations under the lead of IDCOL. The proposed change concerns providing additional grant funding for component C of the Project for financing RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate Change Fund in parallel with the processing of the Project. However, the application process for both funds was only partially finalized by the time the Project was approved by ADB's Board on 2 October 2008. As a consequence, the grant financing will be processed as supplementary financing to be allocated to the Project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the Project will be funded from the following sources, namely: (i) Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB; and (ii) Grant of $1,300,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund. The proposed supplementary grant will complement the ADF funding of $33 million equivalent under component C of the Project. The $2 million allocation under the CEFPF will be used to provide a $25 buy-down grant per individual SHS. This will enable 80,000 low- and middle-income households and micro and small enterprises in IDCOL's solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. While loan financing under component C of the Project is exhausted to a large extent, the proposed supplementary financing will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors. Furthermore, the $1.3 million grant under CCF will provide IDCOL with a total available subsidy amount of $580,000 for the financing of up to 50% of total cost of other renewable energy applications such as biomass and biogas installations in rural areas with no access to grid electricity. The remaining grant amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for expenses related to the administration and monitoring of the renewable energy program such as: (i) $357,000 as program support administration cost of IDCOL for the management and monitoring on the use of the refinancing loans and grant component); (ii) $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of PO staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. Thanks to the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets maintenance, services and spare parts are available in reasonable vicinity of the SHSs customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is around 10 kilometers; (iii) $30,000 earmarked to carry out technical inspections; (iv) $60,000 for annual technical audits carried out by an audit firm for 2 consecutive years; and (v) $40,000 for appointing independent engineers to conduct feasibility studies, appraise and monitor renewable energy projects.\n\n\n\nADB Project 42180-013.\n\n\n\nThe proposed Second Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II or the Project). PPIDF II will build on the efforts of Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF I) in helping address the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh by providing long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through IDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and increase in employment opportunities. The design of the Project serves to attract commercial financing for infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget. An additional objective of the Project is to help provide the rural population and small to medium enterprises in off-grid areas with access to environment-friendly electricity. The proposed financing modalities of the Project. PPIDF II comprises two components, namely: (i) component 1 which will use the proceeds from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) sovereign loan up to $100 million to provide IDCOL with long-term additional resources for the financing of medium to large-sized private sector-led infrastructure projects with a total project cost of minimum $10 million; and (ii) component 2 which will route the proceeds from the sovereign Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of up to $10 million through IDCOL for the further expansion of its successful SHS program which has so far provided financing of more than 2 million SHS through a microfinance-based, direct sales program in rural off-grid areas to provide households and small businesses with a renewable source of energy. Component 1 will provide funding directly to subborrowers in form of providing long-term loans to infrastructure project while component 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating organizations (POs) to the end-user which are typically households in off-grid areas.",

   "IFC Project 30727. Salamander Energy plc (Salamander or the company) is a rapidly-growing junior oil and gas company exclusively focused on Southeast Asia. The company‚Äôs strategy is to build a sustainable upstream business through leveraging its regional knowledge and relationships; maintaining a balanced portfolio of production, development, appraisal and exploration assets; enforcing strict capital allocation discipline; and pursuing targeted acquisitions in addition to organic-led growth. Since its foundation in early 2005, Salamander has developed a broad set of assets, including producing and near-production interests in Indonesia and Thailand as well as exploration and appraisal properties in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao PDR and the Philippines. The company reported net proved and probable reserves of 66.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (‚Äúboe‚Äù) and average daily production of 20,000 boe, of which about 34% is gas.\n\n\n\nSalamander is an existing client of IFC. IFC supported its growth through both debt and equity investments over the last few years. IFC has been requested to continue to support the Company‚Äôs growth by providing up to $75 million debt financing in the forms of both senior and junior lending facilities. The financing will help fund the Company‚Äôs planned 2011-2013 investment program that is primarily expected to cover the capital and operating expenditure needs of the following producing and near-production assets:\n\n\n\n- the E5-N and EU-1 Concessions (Sinphuhorm) and the Block B8/38 Concession (Bualuang) in Thailand; and\n\n- the Offshore North West Java (ONWJ), South East Sumatra (SES) Production Sharing Contracts, and the Glagah Kambuna Technical Assistance Contract in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nThe project will include the drilling of new wells in existing fields, the selective workover of existing wells and the construction of gas processing facilities and other field infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe project will also include the refinancing of existing indebtedness and other general corporate uses. Salamander expects that the project will help it to increase its production to reach 30,000 boe per day by 2013.",

   "IFC Project Number 30477: The investment will support the expansion of Galnaftogaz (GNG), an independent distributor of petroleum products in the Ukraine. \n\n\n\nGNG has financing requirements of $210 million over the next two years for the following activities:\n\n- $150 million for expansion of its gas station network. GNG plans build/reconstruct around 75 high-volume gas filling stations and finance the associated working capital. The stations will be built according to the highest EHS standards and will have energy efficiency elements. \n\n\n\n- $15 million of the investment will be used to purchase energy efficient heating systems, insulation, lighting and electric controls, pumps and more fuel efficient tanker trucks.\n\n\n\nMost of the planned stations will be in central and eastern Ukraine because GNG would like to increase its presence outside of its home region (western Ukraine). The Project is expected to create at least 480-500 new jobs (newly created stations) and preserve another 380-400 jobs (purchased/reconstructed stations), for a total of at least 860 jobs.\n\n\n\n- $60 million to refinance mezzanine debt at GNG‚Äôs holding level.\n\n\n\nGalnaftogaz is an existing IFC client and based in western Ukraine. It operates mainly in the retail segment, through 307 gas filling stations, of which 281 are operated under the proprietary ‚ÄúOKKO‚Äù brand. The Company is the third largest petroleum distribution company in Ukraine by number of stations and the second largest by volume.\n\n\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at about $210 million, while IFC‚Äôs proposed investment is a financing package of $80 million, consisting of an A loan of up to $15 million and a C loan of up to $20 million both for IFC‚Äôs own account, and a syndicated B loan of up to $45 million for the account of participant banks. EBRD is considering matching IFC investment in identical amounts. \n\n\n\nNote that the subsidy amount of $60 million, covering the A and B loans, is entered into this database.",

The objective of the Additional Financing for the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project is to improve the quality and efficiency of the electricity service provision in the main three growth centers of Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro and to establish a sustainable basis for energy access expansion and renewable energy development in Tanzania. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR17.20 million (equivalent of approximately US$27.88 million) to the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project. This additional financing will not entail restructuring of any of the project's components or its implementation arrangements. The current project development objective will remain unchanged and the current closing date will not be extended. The incurred delays under the on-grid part required some necessary changes to the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators. However those changes only relate to a rescheduling of the targets into future years. All activities could be implemented and targets achieved as per the original target values by the current project closing date of March 2015, recently extended because certain on-grid targets would not have been achievable in the original time frame of the project. The results framework was already updated in this regard during the midterm review of December 2010 and reviewed by and agreed with the Bank. The applicability of this updated results framework was reconfirmed during appraisal by the Bank and the borrower including validity of all its indicator values and targets. The total cost of this project is $43,380,000. (Power 98%).",

The Government of Poland faces a dilemma: how can it decrease harmful emissions, while maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with the European Union (EU)-15 and do this within a constrained fiscal environment. The World Bank (the Bank) worked closely with the Government during 2009-10 to address this conundrum in preparing the 2011 report \"Transition to a low emissions economy in Poland,\"  analyzing the carbon abatement potential in Poland and the associated economic impact. The analysis identified energy efficiency and selected renewable energy investments as the priority near- to medium-term investments. Although energy efficiency options are low cost, market penetration has been limited. This DPL supports policy actions that are designed to address market rigidities. Poland faces a problem in achieving bold renewable energy targets as there is little hydropower or deep geothermal potential and solar power is expensive. Biomass applications have recently shown promise and are, along with wind power and biogas, expected to be the focus of attention in meeting Poland's 2020 renewable energy target of 15.0 percent of final energy consumption from renewable energy sources. To support the implementation of its renewable energy policy, the government has established a green certificates program that obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of renewable energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies are available from EC funds used to help decrease renewable energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions. The total cost of this project is $1,114,500,000.  (Renewable energy 17% - Biomass and windpower).",

The additional financing is needed at this time since signed contracts under the project are expected to exceed available financing by September 2011. The implementation experience of this operation, along with the Southern African Power Pool (SAPMP), has generated important lessons for the region, the sector and for projects in post-conflict and fragile settings, which have been incorporated in the additional financing. These include: (i) the need for more robust assessments to underpin cost estimates, including better assessments of conflict related damages; (ii) the need for larger contingency amounts to take into account uncertainties in the supplier market; and (iii) realistic assessment of market interest when preparing bid documents and increased consultation with firms at pre-bid conferences; and (iv) longer implementation periods for projects in post-conflict situations to take into account risk of frequent change in sector leadership and institutional arrangements that necessitate greater Bank supervision.",

   "IBRD/IDA Project ID: P114782.  The objective of the Additional Financing for the Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project for Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is to improve operational efficiency in the electricity sector and expand generation, transmission and distribution capacity in order to better serve domestic power demand and to support regional power market integration. The additional financing is needed at this time since signed contracts under the project are expected to exceed available financing by September 2011. The implementation experience of this operation, along with the Southern African Power Pool (SAPMP), has generated important lessons for the region, the sector and for projects in post-conflict and fragile settings, which have been incorporated in the additional financing. These include: (i) the need for more robust assessments to underpin cost estimates, including better assessments of conflict related damages; (ii) the need for larger contingency amounts to take into account uncertainties in the supplier market; and (iii) realistic assessment of market interest when preparing bid documents and increased consultation with firms at pre-bid conferences; and (iv) longer implementation periods for projects in post-conflict situations to take into account risk of frequent change in sector leadership and institutional arrangements that necessitate greater Bank supervision. The total cost of this project is $380,000,000.",

Current production is between 450MW-550MW. However with ash build up and pileup operation efficiencies will go down and the plant can be shut down if the rehabilitation of the ash plant is not undertaken. The rehabilitation of the Ash Plant will therefore mitigate the ash build up hence ensure availability of the operating plants. Service will also be restored to part of the 22000 customers that have been discontinued due to lack of maintenance and vandalism.\n\n \n\nThe project will also address humanitarian concern to avoid major disruptions in power supply that may lead to grave impacts on the population of the country, particularly as most of the water supply in Harare depends heavily on power consuming treatment plants necessary to prevent future cholera outbreak. The project creates synergy with another Bank intervention \"Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project the objective of which is to provide emergency assistance to the Municipalities of Harare, Chitungwiza, Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu, to improve water production and wastewater treatment capacity and reduce potential of outbreak of water borne diseases",

   "45108-001: On 26 June 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved Loan 2429-VIE: Song Bung 4 (SB 4) Hydropower Project for $196 million, which became effective on 16 January 2009. The Project consists of the construction of a 156-megawatt hydropower plant on the Song Bung in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin and a 110-meter (m)-high roller compacted concrete dam on the same river with a crest length of 367 m. The Project is located in Nam Giang District of Quang Nam Province in Central Viet Nam, which is predominantly inhabited by indigenous people belonging to the Co Tu ethnic minority. The SB 4 Hydropower Project will result in the relocation of more than 1,200 Co Tu ethnic minority people in Zuoih commune in Nam Giang District. The resettlement cost is funded by the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN). The Project is also supported by a complementary grant of $2 million financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) under Grant 9120: Livelihood Improvement of Vulnerable Ethnic Minority Communities Affected by the SB 4 Hydropower Project in Quang Nam Province. The JFPR project was approved by ADB on 26 June 2008 and became effective on 10 November 2008. The SB 4 Hydropower Project has several negative social impacts on the people who live in the reservoir, downstream, and upstream areas. The impacts include the (i) relocation of more than 1,200 people living in the reservoir area, which represents more than 97% of the people in the area, and 27,340 people from 89 villages along the Bung River downstream and upstream of the dam; and (ii) acquisition of land for more than 500 ethnic minority people for the development of resettlement sites and access roads to resettlement sites. In view of these, SB 4 Hydropower Project is considered a high-risk project.\n\n\n\nFunding source: Technical Assistance Special Fund",

To optimize transnational power supply and promote country-wide power transfer in an efficient manner, the Government aims to integrate regional power grid network systems, which comprise five interconnected electrical regions including northern, north-eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region attempts to connect and synchronize power system of neighboring states within the region, but interregional power transfer capacity has still been limited. Since natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in certain locations, surplus power from some regions can be transferred to other regions in power deficit only when creating transmission super highways among the regions. While the existing interregional transmission capacity stands at 22,400 MW, the Government targets to increase this capacity to 27,950 MW by 2012, growing to 57,000 MW by 2015, and 75,000 MW by 2017 under the 12th Five Year Plan. Such interregional transmission strengthening will create a backbone to sustain open power supply and investment in both generation and distribution.",

Power generated is expected to be exported by Indian power trader(s) to neighboring countries including India and Bangladesh through the existing grid connected to India and planned one to Bangladesh. Given that clean and renewable power export will be counted as carbon saving, the resulting reduction of greenhouse gases equivalent to CO2 emissions is estimated as around 1,000,000 tons every year assuming on the Indian grid system benchmark.\n\n\n\nFunding sources: Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction",

Project Description: The Kribi gas power project is Cameroon‚Äôs first IPP and will be operated by Kribi Power Development Corporation (KPDC), an affiliate of AES Sonel. KPDC will receive electricity production and sales licenses from the electricity regulator ARSEL. The Kribi project consists of a gas-fired power plant with a capacity of at least 150MW located in the Mbolongwe village, 9 km north of the coastal city of Kribi in the southern province of Cameroon. A 100 km 225 kV dual transmission line will run between Kribi and the existing Mangombe 225/90kV substation at Ed√©a in the Littoral Province. The choice of technology for the power plant (gas engines or turbines) is being finalized. Additional investment components include the Sanaga South gas field which is being developed by a joint venture between the national oil company (Societ√© Nationale des Hydrocarbures - SNH) and the private company Perenco Cameroun under a production sharing agreement and financed by Perenco, and the CPF site at Bipaga and a gas pipeline linking the CPF and the power plant at Mpolongwe, financed by SNH. Gas supply arrangements between SNH and Perenco (GSA 1) and SNH and KPDC (GSA 2) are being finalized. AES Sonel will be the sole off-taker of electricity produced by KPDC under an arms‚Äô length Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) under negotiation. KPDC will sign an operations and maintenance contract with AES Sonel. The aluminum smelter, Alucam, Cameroon‚Äôs single largest industrial electricity consumer, will ensure a stable base load for the project by taking up to 50MW.

All of the projects will be built by SunEdison‚Äôs EPC Company under a fully-wrapped EPC contract which is price and date certain and provides equipment and full-plant performance warranties for the first 2 years of operation. Beyond this the Operation and Maintenance (‚ÄúO&M‚Äù) will be provided by SunEdison O&M Services arm which will provide plant availability warranties and module supplier will provide degradation rate warranties. \n\nIFC is proposing to make up to 15 % equity contribution to the needs of the Development Company, equivalent to approximately $55 million over the coming 12-18 months. In addition IFC considers providing A Loans in the following amounts: $20 million for the Indian project and $26 million for the four small Thai projects. The expected total project cost will be approximately in the range of $300 - 450 million for the five grid tied projects being debt-financed by IFC. In addition, IFC is considering supporting these projects with financing from the IFC Earth Fund, a platform of the GEF Earth Fund, and the Clean Technology Fund (a fund under the World Bank administered Climate Investment Funds) for the Thai projects.\n\n\n\nIn India, the Alpha project 25MW facility will be located in the newly announced Gujarat Solar Park (being built by Gujarat Power Corporation Ltd (‚ÄúGPCL‚Äù)). The Solar Park is located near Charanka village, in Santalpur Taluka, in the Patan District of Gujarat.

The first is renewable energy. The project will finance renewable resources, such as geothermal, for heating and cooling purposes. \n\n\n\nAt the request of the Financial Intermediary (FI), the eligibility criteria for hydro-power projects have been altered to reflect the definition of renewable hydro-power projects in the renewable energy law, which defines small hydro as projects with a reservoir area limited to less than 15 km. \n\n\n\nThe Clean Technology Fund (CTF) will finance small hydro, those less than or equal to 10 MW in capacity, in addition to other emerging renewable technologies. \n\n\n\nThe second component is investment in energy efficiency. Some of the sub-sectors likely to be borrowers include iron and steel, cement, ceramics, chemicals, and textiles. \n\n\n\nFinally, the third component is the use of CTF resources. The benefits of the CTF financing will be lower interest rates and significantly longer tenor, which are expected to be large enough to significantly increase the incentive to undertake these projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the first project, the participating Banks will borrow directly from the World Bank with a Government guarantee.  Also unlike the first project, the second will have an energy efficiency component, part of which will include technical assistance to stimulate public interest in energy efficiency and to build the capacity of both lenders and borrowers to develop, appraise and implement energy efficiency investments.\n\n\n\nTotal project cost: $650 million; $500 million IBRD and $150 million government",

Also, the study intends to clearly identify and differentiate the missions and responsibilities of the different authorities, so as to avoid inefficiencies and overlap. In particular, in relation to ANP (the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) and PPSA (Pr√©-Sal Petr√≥leos SA, the sub-salt company) the study should consider a transition phase, where ANP will act as PPSA. Thus, the study should suggest what would be the decision-making processes and the major administrative tasks that should be incorporated into ANP which will subsequently be transferred to PPSA.These objectives are consistent with the country strategy in two key areas: (a) productivity and infrastructure ... to use public-private partnership models in new investments ... and (b) modernization of the state and institutional strengthening (as contained in the document GN-2570 of May 4, 2010).",

Subsequently, on 28 March 2008, ADB approved the MFF of an aggregate amount of $600 million to POWERGRID for the Investment Program. Initially, the scope of the program comprised of two projects; Project 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity for Evacuation of Power from Uttarakhand, and Project 2: ?800 kV High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Northeastern Northern/Western Interconnector. However, due to the delay in commissioning of the associated hydropower generating facilities in Uttarakhand, POWERGRID decided to keep on hold the implementation of Project 1 until 2013. As a result, it was decided that all ADB facility of $600 million under the MFF will be utilized to fund Project 2: +800kV HVDC North East - Northern/Western Interconnector in two tranches. Loan Agreements for Tranche 1 (Loan No. 2415-IND: $400 million) and Tranche 2 (Loan No. 2510-IND: $ 200 million) were signed on 28 March 2008 and 27 March 2009, respectively. Current completion dates for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are 30 June 2013, and 30 June 2014, respectively. All contracts under Tranche 1 ($388 million approx.) and Tranche 2 ($119 million approx.) have been awarded in 2010. Based on the contract award, the loan savings of $76 million was confirmed. ADB received the Periodic Financing Request (PFR) for Tranche 3 for an amount of $76 million under the MFF on 21 June 2011 (Appendix 1).

The Hebei provincial government (HPG), through Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau (HFB), will establish a revolving escrow fund (REF) account at the selected financial intermediary to finance eligible energy efficiency subprojects. The subprojects are expected to have a loan repayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these subprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects through the REF.\n\n\n\nThe PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which provided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010. The Government of the PRC has recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated emissions. It has committed to achieve 40% 45% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared with 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions. During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006 2010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011 2015, has set a target of a further 16% energy intensity reduction. More than three fourths of the PRC s electricity and about half of its primary energy are consumed by the industrial sector. The 1,000 Key Enterprises Program was launched during the Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about two-thirds of the total industrial energy consumption. During the Twelfth plan, the ongoing program will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of 10,000 tons of coal equivalent (tce) and higher. It will involve some 16,000 enterprises in the country, primarily among nine energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel, nonferrous metal, coal, power generation, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, textile, and pulp and paper.\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 44012-013.\n\n\n\nThe outcome of the project is increased investments in energy efficiency in Hebei Province. The project is designed to provide a sustainable financing mechanism to finance energy efficiency projects in selected energy-intensive industries in Hebei Province through a financial \n\nintermediary using financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality. The first batch consists of eight subprojects. As the subprojects are expected to have a short payback period (i.e., 5 years), a revolving fund has been established to revolve Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan proceeds \n\ntwo times before it is repaid to ADB. \n\n\n\nGEF funding includes energy efficiency and demand-side management smart grid applications for Hebei Province's industrial sector.\n\n\n\nGlobal Environment Facility funding: $3,655,000\n\n\n\nCounterpart funding: $79,600,000\"",

   "43467-016: The investment program will install separate feeders for households and irrigation water pumps, install high voltage distribution systems (HVDS), provide new power connections, install meters, map the assets of the distribution companies and undertake network analysis to ensure better quality power supply to households and financial sustainability of the distribution companies.\n\n\n\nAt present, power supply lines in rural areas supply power for both agricultural pumps and other customers. This mixed rural distribution network faces several problems: the overuse of subsidized electricity for agricultural water pumping leaves households with an inadequate power supply, and the unauthorized use of electricity causes the DISCOMs to suffer financial losses. Aging and overloaded distribution lines and transformers result in excessive technical losses and poor quality power. To prevent the overuse of electricity by agricultural pumps and to reduce losses, the DISCOMs switch on the distribution lines serving the rural areas for a limited number of hours per day. The existing mixed-feeder system does not allow power to be supplied on a 24-hour basis to households and business establishments, constraining economic growth and development in rural areas. To promote efficient use of groundwater in agriculture and improve on-farm water conservation practices, the DISCOMs supply 3-phase electricity in rural areas for 8 10 hours daily. However, this constraints economic activities and the constant (24-hour) supply of quality power to households. Attempted supply of one phase power, after 8 10-hour supply of three phase power, to reduce overuse of power by irrigation pumps by the DISCOMs was not effective. Separation of power supply lines (feeders) to agriculture and other customers is necessary to ensure the 24-hour supply of power to households. Additional measures such as installation of a HVDS and metering, together with better system management practices are necessary to reduce DISCOMs technical and commercial losses.",

By organizing the collection mainly through catadores (waste collectors), new income earning opportunities are created for a substantial number of disadvantaged people. After being processed in food, the a√ßai pits are normally being dumped illegally or at a local landfill. By processing a√ßai residues into biomass for energy generation in Europe, organic waste methanisation is avoided. In this way, the beneficiaries will earn additional income from carbon credit sales under the Clean Development Mechanism. The private sector is involved in this initiative through the participation of the company VAR do Brazil. The company plans to arrange 80% of its a√ßai residue requirement through catadores who will be organized through a cooperative.",

Over the longer term, Kosmos plans to conduct exploration work on its existing inventory of other licenses in West Africa and to replicate its exploratory success through new ventures in other regions of the African continent.   To fund these activities, Kosmos launched a multipronged approach aimed at tapping the equity and debt markets. This included first raising a US$2 billion debt facility to restructure its existing debt (including IFC‚Äôs prior loan), then taking the Company public to access additional equity, and finally syndicating the debt facility. Kosmos may also seek to increase the facility to US$3 billion, subject to market appetite, liquidity and timing of development activities.

Tranche 1 will financed four subprojects. (ii) build on ongoing capacity support provided by ADB through capacity building technical assistance. Under Tranche 1, the services of a consulting firm will be engaged to provide training to at least 20 staff on (i) strategic corporate planning, business planning, and management, and (ii) accounting, financial management, planning, and control. (iii) support project implementation with focus on detailed engineering, construction supervision, procurement, safeguard compliance, and the preparation of subsequent tranches of the investment program.\n\nEnsuring reliable electricity supply is therefore an important prerequisite to sustaining economic growth at the target of 7.5%-8.0% per year. Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in expanding access to electricity, as the percentage of households without electricity fell from 22% in 1999 to only 3% in 2010. Those communities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather sparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest.\n\n\n\nADB Project 42039-035.\n\n\n\nThe investment program will contribute to meeting electricity demand growth of industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The outcome of the investment program is enhanced capacity of the transmission network to balance power load. The investment program also supports partial implementation of National Power Sector Development Master Plan VII (PDMP VII) to meet growing electricity demand of industrial, commercial and residential consumers throughout Viet Nam, and improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) the entity responsible for financing, managing, and operating the transmission network to ensure reliable electricity supply.

(iii) New and replacements of customer service connections. New and replacement of the low voltage customer service connections and installation of new metering for about 7,500 households in the Gereshk town center area.\n\nThe access to reliable power supply is severely limited in Gereshk. The estimated population of Gereshk District is 70,000, out of which 50,000 people, or 7,500 households, reside within the 6 km radius of the town center. Presently only about 2,500 households have connections to the local electricity distribution system, while 5,000 households claim to await new connections. Some have their own diesel generators which are too expensive for the mass and the poor. Even for those connected to the electricity network, chronic load shedding during both the morning and evening peak hours means that most receive only a few hours of power supply a day and the existing infrastructure does not allow continued access to power.",

Tranche 1 will financed four subprojects. (ii) build on ongoing capacity support provided by ADB through capacity building technical assistance. Under Tranche 1, the services of a consulting firm will be engaged to provide training to at least 20 staff on (i) strategic corporate planning, business planning, and management, and (ii) accounting, financial management, planning, and control. (iii) support project implementation with focus on detailed engineering, construction supervision, procurement, safeguard compliance, and the preparation of subsequent tranches of the investment program.\n\nEnsuring reliable electricity supply is therefore an important prerequisite to sustaining economic growth at the target of 7.5%-8.0% per year. Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in expanding access to electricity, as the percentage of households without electricity fell from 22% in 1999 to only 3% in 2010. Those communities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather sparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest.\n\n\n\nADB Project 42039-035.\n\n\n\nThe investment program will contribute to meeting electricity demand growth of industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The outcome of the investment program is enhanced capacity of the transmission network to balance power load. The investment program also supports partial implementation of National Power Sector Development Master Plan VII (PDMP VII) to meet growing electricity demand of industrial, commercial and residential consumers throughout Viet Nam, and improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) the entity responsible for financing, managing, and operating the transmission network to ensure reliable electricity supply.

   "Within the broad ambit of public sector reform, this series focuses on the crucial energy\n\nsector and reform of electricity in particular as this will be essential for sustained private sector\n\ninvestment and activity. In addition there is a severe under provision of electricity as reflected in\n\nthe low access ratios, variously estimated to be around 5-6 percent of the population. Given the\n\nlong term neglect that has marked the sector this endeavor is one that will require time to bear\n\nfruit.\n\nHousehold survey data show that the vast majority of the population does not use\n\nelectricity for lighting or cooking. Only 2.7 percent of households use public electricity for\n\nlighting and 91 percent of households use kerosene for lighting. Similarly, 85 percent of\n\nhouseholds use firewood for cooking, 14 percent use charcoal, and almost none use public\n\nelectricity.53 In view of these data, any short-run changes in lighting or cooking patterns that\n\nmight result from a temporarily higher electricity tariff would be quite small and would not result\n\nin any significant environmental impacts. The sustained provision of affordable hydroelectricity\n\nshould, over the long-run, induce a shift in lighting and cooking preferences towards electrical\n\nappliances that would have a substantially lower carbon-footprint than kerosene or charcoal.\n\n[Note: details are taken from the Program Document]",

The total project cost for Phase 1 is approximately $139 million. The investment is for the construction and operation of a 25MW power-generation facility using methane gas extracted from Lake Kivu pursuant to a concession agreement between CG and the government of Rwanda (the Phase 1 Pilot Project). CG has applied for a MIGA guarantee of up to $99 million for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of expropriation, transfer restriction, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.\n\n\n\nThe entire project (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves extraction and separation of methane gas from the bottom of Lake Kivu and up to 100 megawatts of power-generation capacity to be implemented in two phases. The Phase 1 Pilot Project will involve gas extraction using a floating barge located approximately 13 kilometers offshore from the city of Kibuye. The extracted gas will be further processed and pumped to the shore for use in a power plant via submerged floating pipeline. Power will be produced by methane powered reciprocating engine generator sets with combined capacity of 25 megawatts, net output. Based on successful implementation of Phase 1, Phase 2 will comprise three additional gas extraction barges and three more power production blocks with 75 megawatt capacity resulting in 100 megawatts of overall power generation.\n\n\n\nThe output will be sold to the Rwandan state-owned utility, Rwanda Electricity Corporation (RECO), formerly known as Electrogaz. Phase 1 output will be connected to the national grid via a new dedicated 11 kV transmission line installed by RECO.  Phase 2 will be connected to the existing 220 kV transmission system via two new transformers to be installed by RECO.",

The second component is the access scale-up. Access scale-up includes intensification of connections to the households and villages in the areas already connected by the grid. The access scale-up will address the low connection intensity in the areas with grid access. The project will finance the materials and equipment required for the last-mile connectivity. The third component is the market development for renewable energy and energy efficient products. Development of stand-alone renewable energy programs such as solar home systems (SHSs), solar lanterns, improved cook-stoves, biogas plants, and similar activities will provide additional coverage for household access to energy (modern lighting, efficient cooking, etc.), especially in areas that are not yet connected to the grid. The target beneficiaries for this component will be the households and villages that are either outside the reach of the electricity grid as well as those that are in the electricity grid area but are unable to afford the connection to electricity services and the associated usage fees (through the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency products).

The major facilities planned for each of the waterfalls are, from upstream to downstream: dam (M'D√®s and Ain Timedrine), power plant water intake, headrace tunnel, access gallery, surge tank, power penstock, power plant and 225 kV substation. \n\n \n\nThe M'D√®z waterfall will have a 120 m drop, a utilizable flow of 48 m3/s and a plant installed capacity of 45 MW. That of El Menzel will have a 240 m drop, a utilizable flow of 67 m3/s and a plant nominal capacity of 125 MW. \n\n \n\nEnergy will be released through two 225 kV lines to El Menzel and Bourdim substations over a 27 km distance. Connection to El Menzel is provided via a 1.7 km line section. Both the M'D√®z and El Menzel plants will be remote-controlled from the Casablanca National Dispatching Centre. Access to the facilities will be by existing paved roads, provisional project site tracks and the permanent roads to be built. \n\n \n\nWorks on the complex will span 42 months. The construction of the hydropower plants and headrace galleries will be borne by ONE at an estimated cost of MDH 2100.",

   "P121590  general energy is 10% of DPL\n\n\n\nAnother key challenge is associated with the need to foster low carbon economic growth in the State, especially related to steel and iron production. Minas Gerais is the largest national producer of steel and iron, responsible for 60 percent of the national production. The State has 62 pig iron mills to supply the sector. Many of these mills use charcoal for energy and as thermo-reducing agent. However, most of the charcoal originates\n\nfrom illegal deforestation of the Cerrado biome (a mosaic of dry forests to savanna woodland). To deal with this issue, the GoMG passed the Law 18365/09, which virtually bans the use of charcoal from deforestation by 2018, as at least 95 percent charcoal consumed in the State must come from managed plantations. A key challenge, however, is that tree planting needs to start soon to meet the demand in 2018. The risk is that in response to this\n\nlaw, the industry could decide to use coal instead of the charcoal from deforestation, increasing the State's Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The State Government is concerned about this possibility and entered in a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank and the German Development Agency KfW in 2010 to develop alternatives to promote tree plantations for charcoal. A key Government objective is to create incentives and conditions for this law to be followed as originally intended, leading to a reduction of GHG emissions.",

There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is upgrading and modernization of the transmission and distribution network. The upgrading and modernization of the transmission and distribution network component includes: (i) the upgrading, rehabilitation or replacement of existing transmission lines and substations in the Interconnected Network of the Client's territory; (ii) the upgrading of the distribution network from 6.6 kV to 30kV from at least two selected substations in Greater Dakar; (iii) the installation of at least 15 remotely controlled Medium Voltage/Low Voltage (MV/LV) distribution substations in Greater Dakar, (iv) the extension and densification of the distribution network in Greater Dakar, and (v) the extension of the Interconnected Network to reach isolated secondary consumption centers of the Client's territory. The second component of the project is improving SENELEC's commercial performance. This component aims at improving SENELEC's commercial performance by reducing the cost of billing, increasing bill collection and reducing non-technical losses through fraud reduction. This component includes: (i) the installation of about 150,000 STS compliant Split Pre-paid Meters in the Client's territory, (ii) the installation of about 10,000 electronic Smart Meters and of a remote meter reading system in the Client's territory, and (iii) the installation of a new electricity customer management system for SENELEC.

The proposed project would lend in parallel along with Societe Generale, DFIs and other commercial lenders to BB Energy- the successful bidder under Government of Mauritania‚Äôs oil import tender arrangement. BB Energy, an international trading company domiciled in the United Arab Emirates, has been awarded a 2-year contract to supply refined oil products to Mauritania for 2012-2014. The funding will be used by BB Energy to finance: (i) purchase of oil products imported into Mauritania and related storage expenses; (ii) as well as related receivables against local oil product marketing companies, and major domestic industrial entities which are consumers of refined fuel products.\n\n\n\nThe facility size will be up to $500 million two year arrangement to finance the importation of refined energy products into Mauritania. ¬†Out of the total¬† $500 million facility, IFC and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale are each considering an exposure of up to $150 million for their respective accounts and both institutions together plan to mobilize up to $200 million from commercial banks and DFIs.",

(WPH), an affiliate of Sithe Global (USA), covering their additional equity investment in the Bujagali hydropower project. In 2007, MIGA issued a guarantee  of $115 million covering WPH‚Äôs initial investment in the project. The investor has increased its equity investment due to additional costs associated with the project. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract. This additional coverage brings MIGA‚Äôs gross exposure under the project to $120.3 million.\n\nThe project consists of the construction and operation of a 250 megawatt, run-of-the-river hydropower plant on the Victoria Nile by Bujagali Energy Ltd. (BEL), of which WPH is a partner. The project was developed on a build-own-operate-transfer basis and reuses water flowing from two existing upstream facilities to generate electricity. The first generating unit was commissioned in February 2012 and the project reached full capacity in June 2012. The project also includes an associated Interconnection Project, which consists of a series of transmission lines to be owned and operated by the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company.\n\nReliable and accessible electricity is critical for Uganda‚Äôs social and economic development. Daily power shortages have stunted economic growth by an estimated one percent of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product. The Bujagali project has increased supply to the national power grid and reduced the need for more costly thermal power..\n\n\n\nIn addition to MIGA‚Äôs guarantee, the World Bank Group is supporting the project with $130 million in loans from the IFC and a partial risk guarantee of up to $115 million from the International Development Association. MIGA‚Äôs guarantee was essential to securing Sithe Global‚Äôs investment.",

The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.\n\nThe Eolo project involves the construction of a 44 megawatt wind farm in Rivas Province on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. Eolo consists of 22 Gamesa G90 2 megawatt wind turbine generators, as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generators to a high-voltage substation. It is estimated that Eolo will be able to generate approximately 169.6 gigawatt hours of electricity per year, without requiring any fossil fuel supply. The wind farm is expected to start operations by December of 2012 and the electricity will be purchased by local distribution companies Distribuidora de Electricidad del Norte, S.A. (Disnorte) and Distribuidora de Electricidad del Sur, S.A. (Dissur).\n\nNicaragua‚Äôs electrification rate is among the lowest in Central America. Additionally, reliance on thermal (oil-fired) generating plants has made the long-term marginal costs the highest in the region. This project aims to provide additional generation capacity that is not only renewable and clean, but also helps reduce the average marginal cost of generation, resulting in an overall reduced cost of electricity to users.\n\nMIGA‚Äôs participation in the project is aligned with the agency‚Äôs commitment to support investment into into countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association and investment in infrastructure.",

   "P118916   The development objective is to strengthen the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF) Project as a single window institution to appraise infrastructure Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects requiring government guarantees. There are two components to the project. The first component of the project is Word Bank (WB)-Supported IIGF Guarantees. The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA). The Project will provide a loan for TA in the amount of approximately $4.6 million to develop IIGF's institutional capacity to: screen, appraise and supervise IIGF-projects as a single window for all government guarantees for infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia; manage its operations; build capacity in Contracting Agencies (CAs), sponsors and other relevant parties; develop standardized documents and procedures for contracting agencies, sponsors and other relevant parties to use in preparing PPP projects and require the use of such documents and procedures in order for PPP projects to receive IIGF guarantees; and support PPP preparation activities, including feasibility studies, transaction advisory support and other activities\n\n\n\nOCI Note on Coal:  Given that the GOI‚Äôs Fast Track I power projects were predominantly coal plants, without significant changes to the Fast Track project list, it essentially dictated that WBG infrastructure assistance would further accelerate development of the coal industry. So far, the Fast Track I projects listed as ‚Äúunder development‚Äù include 40 coal power plants totaling 16.4 GW. In total, coal generation accounts for 94% of the Fast Track I generation capacity.  Moreover, the first project to receive an IIGF guarantee in October 2011 was the huge coal-powered Central Java Power Project (or Jawa Tengah Power Plant).  IIGF has also extended a guarantee to Puruk Cahu-Bangkuang Coal Railway, a US$3 billion, 385 km rail project to connect coal mines in northern Kalimantan to a port at Batanjung in southern Kalimantan.",

   "P125996  The development objectives of the Distribution Efficiency Project are to improve the performance of Vietnam's power corporations (PCs) in providing quality and reliable electricity services, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through demand side response and efficiency gains. There are three components to the project. The first component is system expansion and reinforcement. This component will cover construction and reinforcement of 110 kV, Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, including substations, of the PCs. These investments will help the PCs to efficiently meet load growth, address load supply constraints due to distribution system congestion, reduce losses, and improve reliability and quality of power supply. The second component is introduction of smart grid technologies in distribution. This component, which includes Clean Technology Fund (CTF) co-financing, will focus on (i) automation, through introduction of supervisory control and data acquisition systems, of electricity distribution network operations of and data collection by the PCs; and (ii) introduction of Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, including two-way communication systems, as electricity distribution smart grid technologies for key substations and consumers of selected PCs. Supporting the first stage of the roadmap for smart grid technologies for power distribution in Vietnam, the component will assist to increase efficiency, reliability and effectiveness of the PCs' systems and operations, and optimize distribution system configuration by providing real time data from both the supply and the demand side. The third component is technical assistance and capacity building. \n\n\n\nFinancing: Australia: Australian Agency For International Development $7,600,000; IDA $448,900,000; Clean Technology Fund $30,000,000",

There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is access to electricity. This component will support the Solar Home Systems (SHS) and other renewable energy options for increasing access to electricity. The component will also include technical assistance support to Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) for capacity building, inspection and monitoring, impact evaluation, training, and other related activities for ensuring effective implementation. The second component of the project is household energy. This component supports the efforts of various Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in providing rural households with clean cooking solutions. The component will build on the success of Bangladeshi NGOs in the areas of community outreach in total sanitation programs. The third component of the project is energy efficient lighting. This component will support the distribution of 7.25 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in predominantly rural areas where these energy efficient CFLs are not yet widely used. The fourth component of the project is sector technical assistance. This will support developing national guidelines for safe disposal/recycling of CFLs and capacity building for ensuring safe disposal of CFLs financed under the project.",

The coverage is for Apache‚Äôs investments into its subsidiaries in Egypt. MIGA‚Äôs reinsurance coverage is for a period of up to 13 years against the risks of expropriation and breach of contract. The project covered by OPIC involves existing and future exploration and development and production of crude oil, natural gas, and condensate for which multiple concession agreements have been granted by the government of Egypt.\n\nMIGA‚Äôs support to OPIC is in accordance with MIGA‚Äôs mandate to cooperate with national entities of its member countries, as stated in MIGA‚Äôs Convention. By providing facultative reinsurance, MIGA is enabling OPIC to provide the amount of coverage Apache has requested and was not available from private market insurers.\n\nThis project entails the reinsurance of a pool of new and existing investments by Apache, an oil and gas exploration and production company. Apache, through its existing and planned additional investments, has signaled its intention to stay in Egypt and to expand operations. Apache also provides technical training in new technologies to Egyptian nationals working in the joint ventures, contributes to the modernization and efficiency of the oil and gas production sector, and is playing a critical role in helping Egypt‚Äôs supply of energy products keep up with domestic demand.

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5¬∞C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations. DPO2 was designed in close coordination with SP-RCC co-financiers as a continuation of DPO1.\n\n\n\nWB reports 30% of $70 million for energy efficiency.",

There are two components of the project. The first component of the project is financing the initial investment. This component wills development of the plant through the formation of a PPP between the Borrower and a competitively selected partner, and construction of the Associated Facilities. The second component of the project is operational support. This component will support the acquisition of kilowatt-hours produced by the project implementing entity to partially cover the difference in the price at which the Borrower would buy the electricity generated by the Plant and the price at which the Borrower would sell such electricity to ONE. \n\nTotal project cost: $1,438 million.

Tranche 1 mainly focuses on generation expansion. Tranche 2 focuses on transmission and distribution improvement together with a pilot solar irrigation component. Tranche 3 also invests on generation expansion. Generation expansion in the MFF will be undertaken through supply side energy efficiency improvement so that about 50% power can be generated without burning additional gas. Given the acute gas shortages in Bangladesh, conversion of single cycle gas fired power plants to combined cycle plants the technology adopted in the investment program is the best way to expand the generation capacity. The sequencing of the tranches is well aligned with the sector needs and the government program. The Tranche 1 of the proposed Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program will address two key areas in the power sector aligning with the priorities identified in the CPS: improving energy use efficiency of thermal power plants; and improving the transmission network capacity. The project interventions will include: (i) adding 235 MW capacity by conversion of four single cycle gas fired power plants to combine cycle plants at Khulna, Baghabari, Sylhet and Shahjibazar; (ii) construction of 180 km 132 kV transmission lines and four 133/32 kV substations; and (iii) capacity building.

   "32170  Equatorial Energia S.A. (‚ÄúEQTL‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a holding company with investments in Brazil‚Äôs electricity sector and an existing IFC partner, is seeking financing from IFC to support (i) the turnaround and expansion of Centrais Electricas do Para S.A. (‚ÄúCELPA‚Äù) and (ii) the potential future acquisition and turnaround of other power distribution companies in Northern and Central Brazil (together, the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù). \n\n\n\nCELPA is the distribution company of the State of Para, covers a service area of 1.25 million square kilometers (the size of France, the UK and Spain combined) and serves close to 1.8 million customers representing a population of nearly seven million people as of end of 2011. CELPA was privatized and acquired by Rede En√©rgia S.A. (‚ÄúRede‚Äù) in 1998. Since then, CELPA has been underperforming and filed for Brazil‚Äôs Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2012 as it was unable to meet its debt obligations. \n\n\n\n In June 2012, EQTL presented a buyout proposal to Rede, acquired Rede‚Äôs 61.4% ownership of CELPA and formally took over on November 1, 2012. The remaining stake is held by Brazil‚Äôs federal, integrated power utility, El√©trobras (34.2%) and others (4.4%).\n\n\n\nThe current operational condition of CELPA is uncertain and the provision of reliable electricity to the population is severely compromised. Once the Project reaches financial close, a knowledgeable and experienced partner will step-in to restructure and undertake significant investment to improve and expand CELPA's power network, increase operational efficiencies and achieve productivity gains. In turn, the quality and reliability of the service will improve and should, over time, translate into better access to electricity for one of the poorest and most underserved regions of Brazil. In addition, industrial and commercial activities in the region, particularly agricultural activities, will directly benefit from reliable and good quality electricity.",

   "IFC Project 31383.  \n\n\n\nThe project consists in the development, construction and operation of a 305.5 MW hydropower generation plant (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù) in the Reventaz√≥n river basin located in Siquirres, province of Lim√≥n, Costa Rica. The construction process has started and the Project is expected to start operations in 2016. \n\n\n\nThe Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh annually, on average, once operational; representing around 10% of the energy expected to be produced in Costa Rica by then.  The Project will be developed through a special purpose vehicle (Fideicomiso Reventaz√≥n or the ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù, a Costa Rican trust). The Trust is expected to lease the Project to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (‚ÄúICE‚Äù) when operational. The Project is expected to have high economic and developmental impact in the following ways: 1) provision of critical infrastructure to support economic growth: the Project is expected to generate around 1,400 GWh of base-load power generation annually, or about 10% of the country's total generation, helping to meet increasing power demand driven by economic growth; 2) decreasing carbon emissions through the displacement of fossil-fuel powered generation. \n\n\n\nThe proposed IFC investment consists in a US$100 million A Loan. The remaining debt financing for the Project is expected to be provided by the Interamerican Development Bank (‚ÄúIDB‚Äù) and a group of international institutional investors.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1056.\n\n\n\nThe project consists of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a 305.5 MW hydroelectric plant and its associated facilities including transmission lines, substations and access roads to be located in the Province of Limon, located at 8 kilometers southeast of the city of Siquirres in Costa Rica.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-L1049.\n\n\n\nICE and the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica, have requested to the IDB a Second Operation under the CCLIP CR-X1005, to finance investments for the Reventaz√≥n Hydroelectric Project (RHP).The Operation is consistent with the objective of the CCLIP CR-X1005 and is included in the Borrower's investment plan for the electricity sector.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1086.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this TC (technical cooperation grant) is provide technical assistance in the development and implementation of the strategy adopted to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of the PHR, in particular measures envisaged to maintain biological connectivity corridor habitat biodiversity caused by the new reservoir, well, development of best practices in social and environmental assessment related to environmental compensation.\n\n\n\nIDB Project CR-T1074. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this ordinary capital is to complete the environmental studies necessary for the financing of the Reventazon Hydroelectric Project (PHR). The 306-MW hydro project is planned for the area of Siquirres in Limon province and would use water from the Reventazon, and supply 524,000 homes. Project works include a 130-meter-high, 527-meter-wide concrete face rockfill dam, a 1.68-kilometer water transport tunnel and four Francis turbines. The PHR will increase power generation available to the Regional Electricity Market, to be sell through the transmission line that is part of SIEPAC.

   "8296  In December 2012, MIGA issued guarantees totaling $116.1 million covering an investment by Globeleq Holdings (Azito) Limited of Bermuda in the Azito Thermal Power Plant in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract.\n\nThe project involves the conversion of the existing Azito Thermal Power Plant from simple-cycle to combined-cycle. This will include the addition of a steam turbine generator and heat recovery systems as well as the facilities and equipment required to connect the generator to the plant‚Äôs 225 kV substation. The project will add approximately 140 megawatts of installed capacity to the grid, without requiring any additional gas supply, for a total plant installed capacity of approximately 430 megawatts. Since the expansion from a simple-cycle to a combined-cycle plant was foreseen when the first phase of the project was completed in 1999, the related facilities and transmission line were designed to accommodate the full plant expansion and output.\n\nC√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire‚Äôs energy infrastructure suffers from lack of maintenance, system overload, and financial difficulties. Due to limited access, over three-quarters of households are dependent on cheap wood charcoal, though this has environmental and health costs in the long term. The project is aligned with the World Bank Group‚Äôs Country Assistance Strategy for C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, which stresses the critical importance of building energy capacity to sustain economic progress.\n\n\n\nMIGA‚Äôs support for this investment is also aligned with the agency‚Äôs strategy of supporting investments into countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association, countries affected by conflict, and complex infrastructure projects.",

Tranche 1 will financed four subprojects. (ii) build on ongoing capacity support provided by ADB through capacity building technical assistance. Under Tranche 1, the services of a consulting firm will be engaged to provide training to at least 20 staff on (i) strategic corporate planning, business planning, and management, and (ii) accounting, financial management, planning, and control. (iii) support project implementation with focus on detailed engineering, construction supervision, procurement, safeguard compliance, and the preparation of subsequent tranches of the investment program.\n\nEnsuring reliable electricity supply is therefore an important prerequisite to sustaining economic growth at the target of 7.5%-8.0% per year. Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in expanding access to electricity, as the percentage of households without electricity fell from 22% in 1999 to only 3% in 2010. Those communities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather sparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest.\n\n\n\nADB Project 42039-035.\n\n\n\nThe investment program will contribute to meeting electricity demand growth of industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The outcome of the investment program is enhanced capacity of the transmission network to balance power load. The investment program also supports partial implementation of National Power Sector Development Master Plan VII (PDMP VII) to meet growing electricity demand of industrial, commercial and residential consumers throughout Viet Nam, and improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) the entity responsible for financing, managing, and operating the transmission network to ensure reliable electricity supply.

   "ADB Project 46472-001.\n\n\n\nThe proposed TA is a timely response to the government's request for ADB's assistance for the implementation of the NECP in the PRC. The proposed TA is aligned with NEA's priorities for developing a comprehensive New Energy City Framework and establishing appropriate support mechanisms to deploy distributed renewable energy applications. The TA will provide a best practice model in planning, appraising, implementing distributed renewable energy development in second-tier cities of Gansu and other provinces. A successful demonstration in the two cities of Dunhuang and Wuwei how to address critical capacity barriers for the effective implementation of the NECP will facilitate its replication The lessons learned from this TA will be shared and discussed with NEA, other relevant cities and provinces, and other relevant stakeholders. The TA concept fits very well with the government's priority of fostering green and low-carbon development, and is fully consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy (2011-2015) for the PRC with emphasis on promoting resource efficiency, environmentally sustainable growth, and addressing climate change. The TA is expected to deliver the following outputs: (i) Priority projects of Dunhuang and Wuwei cities are appraised and prepared for implementation. (ii) Capacity strengthened in planning and implementing the NECP. (iii) Pilot projects implemented for demonstration in both cities. (iv) Best practices in the NECP implementation developed and disseminated.\n\n\n\nThe NECP targets a representative set of second-tier cities with varying economic structures, load characteristics and renewable energy resource endowment. By 2015, each of the selected demonstration cities shall make full use of its locally available renewable energy sources and would have doubled its existing share of renewable energy in its overall energy mix to a minimum threshold level of 6% in 2010. Furthermore, by 2015, each city shall install (i) solar thermal plants covering an area of at least 1.0 square kilometer, (ii) solar photovoltaic panels of 20.0 megawatt, (iii) distributed wind power of at least 100 megawatt, and (iv) shallow-geothermal installations and heat pumps covering an area of 3.0 square kilometers and biomass utilization shall reach 0.1 million ton of coal equivalent per year. Gansu Province is located in the central-west region of the PRC. Measured by a per capita gross domestic product standard, Gansu Province is ranked 27 among the 31 provinces in the PRC. It relies on tourism and industries for its economic growth. Dunhuang city, as a world cultural heritage site, and Wuwei city, with its long-standing history, are at the heart of the tourism development strategy of the province. While tourism infrastructure has been built up over the past decades, the greening of the cities energy sector is important to improve the local air quality to ensure its attractiveness to tourists. Wuwei city s central location makes it an important business and transportation hub; many major railroads and national highways pass through Wuwei. Both Dunhuang and Wuwei cities are endowed with significant renewable energy resources, in particular rich solar resources characterized by (i) high solar irradiation with more than 3,000 sunshine hours per year, (ii) a cool continental climate with an annual average temperature of about 9 degrees Celsius, and (iii) broad and flat deserted areas adjacent to urban agglomerations of the cities. These characteristics make the cities ideal for both distributed as well as large-scale development of solar power generation. Dunhuang city has been at the forefront to demonstrate solar photovoltaic (PV) applications in urban areas. Dunhuang's new energy city masterplan to double its existing share of renewable in its energy mix to more than 27% by 2015 was approved by NEA and it was selected as the demonstration city under the NECP. Dunhuang s masterplan involves investment of CNY26.8 billion by 2015 mainly in the areas of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal installations, micro-grid establishment to connect distributed renewable energy sources within the city, and supporting infrastructure to facilitate the use of electric vehicles. Wuwei is a major transport hub and tourist city in Gansu Province. Unlike Dunhuang, its existing share of renewable in the energy mix is only 3.25% by 2011, which it aims to increase to 8.38% by 2015. Wuwei city s masterplan was submitted to NEA in August 2012 and it was evaluated in October 2012 for formal inclusion in the new energy city program in December 2012. The Wuwei masterplan aims for investments of CNY837 million by 2015 for more than 200,000 solar heating applications, more than 30 MW solar PV capacity addition, more than 30 MW biomass power and 72 MW small hydropower projects. Both Dunhuang and Wuwei municipal governments face multiple technological, institutional, administrative, and financial challenges in scaled-up investments in developing and integrating distributed renewable energy in the local energy supply mix. The NECP implementation will pose significant challenges for cities to (i) translate the concepts for identified priority projects into financially and technologically viable projects; (ii) institute effective planning and implementation mechanisms to swiftly adjust the city s action and investment plan in view of NECP commitments; (iii) establish appropriate fiscal and financial support mechanisms to facilitate public, private, and public-private investments; (iv) begin data collection, monitoring and verification to effectively supervise the implementation of the plan; (v) establish and ascertain a close cooperation both between different departments within the municipal government as well as between the administration, private sector, and civil society throughout the plan s implementation; and (vi) supplement the plan with smart policy actions and measures to enhance energy conservation and energy efficiency effectively reducing the new renewable energy capacity required to achieve the target share in final energy consumption. The capacity of relevant staff of the city governments needs to be strengthened to effectively overcome these challenges and to ensure the timely implementation of the NECP in each city. To field test the readiness of each city and applicability of the recommended implementation measures, a pilot project will also be implemented in both Dunhuang and Wuwei. The pilot projects will test at small-scale a key priority project of each of the cities. Pilot projects will help to demonstrate the best practices in (i) project selection, (ii) technical design, (iii) economic and financial viability appraisal, (iv) permitting and agreement of fiscal support by the government, (v) procurement and installation of distributed energy applications, and (vi) project licensing to both municipal governments as well as potential investors.",

Tranche 1 mainly focuses on generation expansion. Tranche 2 focuses on transmission and distribution improvement together with a pilot solar irrigation component. Tranche 3 also invests on generation expansion. Generation expansion in the MFF will be undertaken through supply side energy efficiency improvement so that about 50% power can be generated without burning additional gas. Given the acute gas shortages in Bangladesh, conversion of single cycle gas fired power plants to combined cycle plants the technology adopted in the investment program is the best way to expand the generation capacity. The sequencing of the tranches is well aligned with the sector needs and the government program. The Tranche 1 of the proposed Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program will address two key areas in the power sector aligning with the priorities identified in the CPS: improving energy use efficiency of thermal power plants; and improving the transmission network capacity. The project interventions will include: (i) adding 235 MW capacity by conversion of four single cycle gas fired power plants to combine cycle plants at Khulna, Baghabari, Sylhet and Shahjibazar; (ii) construction of 180 km 132 kV transmission lines and four 133/32 kV substations; and (iii) capacity building. The capacity building component includes training on investment planning, operations planning, energy auditing and monitoring, financial management and auditing, project preparation and appraisal, and operation and maintenance of solar irrigation pumps.

This will be done in partnership with UNIDO and its Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, which is also supported by the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE). The Regional Observatory serves a tested model in the region for this type of work and IDB support to its activities will help consolidate what The Regional Observatory has managed to develop in the 11 above-mentioned countries. In addition to supporting new activities in The Regional Observatory, the support of this TC will also contribute to expanding The Regional Observatory¬øs reach to an additional 15 LAC countries (Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, and Venezuela) allowing it to eventually operate in all 26 IDB Member-countries. The additionality of this TC is its ability to produce the transparency and knowledge of each country specific market that is needed to spur investment at a level that makes a significant impact improving the energy security of the region. The three studies to be funded by this TC will accomplish this at a level not before seen in renewable energy research in the LAC region. This TC is therefore primarily linked to the UNIDO¬øs Regional Observatory for Renewable Energy in LAC, but will be executed in close coordination with another relevant UN initiative: the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative . Both are initiatives where the IDB has publically committed to supporting LAC efforts in renewables, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. The information generated from these three studies directly supports both of these initiatives; the measurements and data provided by the studies will be essential to better prioritizing technologies per country, which projects to support, their funding and how much, and even identifying knowledge gaps, and this holds true for our work internally at the IDB as well as for those actors in each of the countries being studied where this information will be shared through regional workshops. Specifically this TC will also help projects that are in the planning stages or already approved by providing the most up-to-date financial information thus improving or confirming the financial structure of projects such as wind power generation projects in Mexico or the financial scenario of solar projects in Chile. In short, this TC is intended to provide essential market analysis that pushes forward the region's work in three areas: renewables energy, energy efficiency, and universal access to modern energy. This TC is consistent with the Bank¬øs GCI-9 sector priorities because helping increase the market penetration of renewable energy will contribute to an increase in the use of sustainable energy, the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and toward a reduction in poverty.",

(APSCL) in Bangladesh. HSBC coordinated and arranged a $406 million financing package to APSCL for the project. On March 8, 2013, MIGA issued additional coverage of $30 million covering a swap arrangement to hedge against long-term interest rate risk. MIGA‚Äôs guarantees are for a period of up to 13.5 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations. The Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh has provided an unconditional sovereign guarantee covering payment obligations of APSCL under the debt financing and the swap.\n\nThe project consists of the construction of a 450-megawatt combined cycle gas-fired plant on the basis of a contract awarded by APSCL to a consortium of TSK Electronica y Electricidad S.A. (Spain) and Inelectra International AB (Sweden). This project will replace certain existing units in the Ashuganj facility that will be decommissioned once the new plant is completed.\n\nBangladesh currently faces an acute shortage of power generation capacity. This impairs the country's economic and social development and constrains growth. The government of Bangladesh has made energy a high priority and recently adopted an updated Power Sector Master Plan, which includes this project. This project will help meet the country‚Äòs growing demand for power, using a domestic gas resource and efficient technology.\n\nMIGA's participation in this transaction is critical to mobilizing the debt financing for this project.

   "31482  Butec is a mid-size family-owned Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor based in Beirut, Lebanon, and a current IFC client. Butec established a new company - Butec Utility Services (BUS) - which has been awarded a four year Power Distribution Service Provider (DSP) contract for the Northern Lebanon region serving 350,000 households. BUS, to be majority owned by Butec, will execute the DSP contract along with several partners experienced in Power Distribution. Butec‚Äôs partners on this project, including ERDF (the wholly owned distribution subsidiary of √âlectricit√© de France), El-Sewedy (Egypt) and AT Kearney, have a track record of successful projects in countries facing similar challenges. Butec has approached IFC to provide financing for BUS.\n\n\n\n1. Support the reform of the power sector: IFC's strategy for Lebanon is to help the government put the country's economy on a path of sustained, high, and broad-based economic growth. An investment in a DSP as a first step towards reform has the potential to address that.\n\n 2. Promoting private sector participation: The DSP contracts are a step towards greater private participation in the power sector in Lebanon, one that fits well within the IFC's strategy for Lebanon.\n\n 3. Decrease distribution network losses: one of the main incentives behind outsourcing the operations and maintenance of the distribution network and the installation of a network of smart meters is the minimization of losses, technical and non-technical. An investment in Butec will help decrease these losses and improve the efficiency of the network.\n\n 5. Higher quality of service: upgrading the distribution network, while decreasing the losses, will increase the quality of service to the customers through wider access to the network and/or shorter load shedding periods.",

The deposit, which was acquired by Ivanhoe from BHP Billiton in 2000, consists of a near surface (Southern Oyu) copper/gold orebody together with a high grade deposit (Hugo North) suitable for underground mining discovered in 2002. With resources of almost 80 billion pounds of copper and 45 million ounces of gold, Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world‚Äôs largest known copper/gold deposits. \n\n\n\n The Project is being developed in phases starting with construction of a copper concentrator and associated infrastructure to support production of 100,000 tonnes per day of ore, to be sourced predominantly from the Southern Oyu open pit mine development. In parallel underground infrastructure and mine development is ongoing for the Hugo North deposit. Commercial operations from the initial open pit mining development are expected to start in mid-2013. Underground production from Hugo North is expected to commence in 2016. A potential expansion of concentrator capacity (subject to required regulatory approvals and the identification and permitting of additional water resources) to 160,000 tonnes per day of ore, is currently being studied. Mine output, in the form of copper concentrate, will be trucked along a dedicated new road to the China border, to reach the Company‚Äôs primary target market of Chinese copper smelters. Power for the initial years of operations will be sourced from China, to be replaced by an on-site captive coal fired plant, which is currently in the advanced planning phase, with initial earth site work expected to start in Spring 2013.\n\n\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi (‚ÄúOT‚Äù) project is a large-scale copper and gold mine consisting of an open-pit as well as an underground mine located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The OT mining operations will be powered for the first four years by imported electricity from China.  After four years, the project Investor Agreement with the Mongolian government requires the project to source its power needs domestically. Accordingly, a brand new on-site coal-fired power plant (‚ÄúPower Plant‚Äù) will be constructed which will power the mine for the long-term. The Power Plant will consist of five boilers of 150 MW capacity each, for a total of 750 MW, and will be fueled by coal from the nearby Tavan Tolgoi coal mine.   http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Tolgoi_assessment_Final.pdf?docID=11801\n\n\n\nThe total project cost $7.1 billion. The coal plant cost $500 million, representing 7% of project costs.  Coal accounts for 7% of the IFC's $400 million or $28 million.  http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-13/mongolia-seeks-investors-for-thermal-plant-to-power-oyu-tolgoi\n\n\n\nIFC‚Äôs  investment is a $400 million senior A Loan together with a B Loan of up to $600 million loan to be syndicated to international commercial banks, as part of a proposed $4billion project debt financing.

   "P143645  Over the last several years, Tanzania has witnessed a growing power generation deficit caused by: (a) the below-average hydrology conditions that have reduced hydropower generation capacity; and (b) insufficient development of new generation capacity relative to the growing demand for electricity. The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has begun to implement a strategy to place the power sector on a more sustainable path. The discovery of important offshore natural gas reserves presents Tanzania with a potentially transformational opportunity for the country. The Government is determined to, and has started the process of, implementing an appropriate policy framework for the optimal use of future natural gas revenues. A programmatic approach is being proposed to support the Government in addressing the above challenges. The operation is consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY12-15 and the Africa regional strategy. The development objective of the program is to: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in its power sector; (ii) reduce the cost of power supply and to promote private sector participation in the power sector; and (iii) to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's natural gas resources",

The Project includes the construction of a 2.8 km-long transmission line. Aura is being developed by Gauss Energ√≠a (‚ÄúGauss‚Äù), an independent Mexican energy consultancy/developer and will be 100% owned by Corporacion Aura Solar, (‚ÄúCAS‚Äù). The Project will be constructed and operated under an EPC contract with an experienced engineering firm and PV panels will be supplied by a top-class PV manufacturer. Construction will last approximately 8 months and Aura is expected to be commissioned by August 2013.  Mexican sole power utility CFE will act as off-taker of the Project under a 20-year  take-and-pay and will pay Aura Solar the applicable Short Term Marginal Cost or ‚ÄúCosto Total de Corto Plazo‚Äù at the La Paz node. Aura is the first private utility scale project to be developed under this framework and the largest PV solar plant to be built to date in Mexico. \n\n \n\nThe Project will contribute to increase the share of clean and renewable energy in Mexico, specifically in BCS, an area mainly powered by fossil fuel generation. \n\n \n\nThe Project will contribute an additional 30 MW towards Mexico's stated target of achieving at least 35% penetration of renewable energy and other \"clean\" power generation sources in its energy matrix by 2025. Given its location in Baja California Sur (BCS) and the State's current energy matrix, the Project will substitute the carbon-intensive HFO and diesel -fired power generation delivered to approx 160,0000 inhabitants with a clean, renewable energy source, and will displace approx. 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. \n\n\n\nBy reducing the reliance on imports of fossil fuels to BCS, the Project is also expected to significantly reduce environmental risks associated with transporting such fossil fuels through environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Sea of Cortez . In addition, the Project is estimated to generate approx. 150-200 direct-employment positions during its construction period.",

CG currently owns over 30 power plants around the world totaling approximately 2.8 GW of installed capacity and projects under construction by YE 2013. These include thermal (fueled by natural gas, diesel, fuel oil and coal), wind, solar, and hydro types of power generation. CG also owns and operates small captive energy generation facilities on-site for commercial beverage bottling companies worldwide. IFC‚Äôs proposed loan of up to $150mm and syndication of up to $100mm for a total of $250mm would support future CG growth through a combination of greenfield engineering and construction and acquisition of existing facilities. The use of proceeds would be restricted to IFC countries of operation and will exclude any investment in coal-fired power plants. Opportunities for greenfield projects consist of wind, hydro, and solar power in South America and Africa; thermal power in Africa, and thermal power in Southeastern Europe. Potential acquisitions include opportunities in Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\n\n\n\nCG is planning to invest an average ~US$650 million over the next three years as the acquisition and development projects in its pipeline reach financial close. This will be financed by IFC‚Äôs loan as well as from dividends from its existing operating companies. \n\n The proposed IFC investment is a US$235 million, comprising: i) a US$135 million senior secured loan for IFC‚Äôs own account and ii) up to $100 million in parallel or B loans.",

   "33120   The proposed project is to build and operate around 500 liquefied natural gas (‚ÄúLNG‚Äù) fueling stations with an objective to make LNG available as a cleaner and cheaper substitute of diesel for long-haul buses and heavy trucks along the key transportation lines across 14 provinces in China (the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù).  A typical LNG truck will have 90% fewer NOX and PM emissions than a diesel truck, 100% fewer SOX emissions, and 30% fewer Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. LNG fuel also enjoys very favorable economics over petroleum‚Äì with fuel cost savings typically reported in the 30% range as compared to diesel. The objective of the Project is to, together with other similar projects currently undertaken by other gas distribution companies, build a country-wide LNG distribution network in China that will make LNG available to thousands of long-haul buses and heavy trucks along the major inter-province highways and it is expected that the increased availability of the LNG will stimulate a broad conversion of heavy trucks and long haul buses from traditionally being diesel powered to gas powered. \n\n\n\nThe sponsor of the Project is ENN Energy Holdings Ltd (‚ÄúENN‚Äù), formerly known as Xinao Gas, an existing IFC client and a leading gas distribution company in China. ENN is registered in Cayman Islands and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ENN was founded in 1993 and is one of the largest privately-owned gas distribution companies in China operating almost 20,000km of city gas distribution networks in 14 provinces/municipalities in Eastern and Central China, serving a connected population of about 53 million in 110 cities, with 7.4 million household connections and 27,000 commercial and industrial users. ENN Group employs 22,000 people in over 100 subsidiaries. \n\n\n\n Mr. Wang is co-founder, Chairman, and a controlling shareholder of ENN. He and his wife, Ms. Zhao Baoju, collectively own 30.11% of ENN, largely through their ownership of ENN Group International Investment Limited, a BVI-domiciled company. The remaining ownership is split between Capital Research and Management company 12%, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (9%), JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The project has 3 components. (1) Extension of electricity transmission and distribution systems component will provide access to electricity to about 10,300 new users located not only in Monrovia but also outside of the capital, along the corridor to the town of Kakata. In addition, the transmission line along the corridor will have the capacity to connect around other 6,000 new consumers if additional financing becomes available. (2) Construction of facilities for off-loading, transport, and storage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and support for optimization of HFO procurement component will support the government's decision to replace current expensive diesel-based generation with less costly HFO-based thermal generation. There are both physical and commercial aspects to optimizing the supply of fuel. Firstly, more reliable HFO supply will require physical investments in HFO off-loading, transport and storage facilities. Secondly, it requires improving HFO procurement practices. (3) Support for the expansion of supply options and for the strengthening of the sector's institutional capacity component will support the overall strengthening of Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy?s institutional capacity to plan and implement electricity access programs.",

There are three components to the project. The first component is the conversion of existing heat-only-boiler plants to combined heat and power plants. The project will convert existing heat-only-boiler plants to combined heat and power plants at six sites. All plants will use natural gas as the main fuel. The largest plant will be in Borisov with a combined heat and power (CHP) unit with an electricity capacity of about 65 MW, followed by the Mogilev combined cycle CHP plant of 15.5 MW of electricity capacity. The introduction of combined heat and power generation will improve efficiency of the plants and thus reduce gas consumption. The second component is the design and supervision consultancy. The design and supervision consultancy will be performed by Belarusian design institutes and financed by the Belarusian side. In addition, the component will also finance construction management and investment monitoring. Finally, the third component is the project Implementation and management. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will carry out the procurement, contract supervision, and financial management of the project including auditing and other fiduciary requirements.\n\n\n\nP133442 An additional loan in the amount of US$90 million to the Republic of Belarus for the Energy Efficiency Project.

   "32938  NEOgas do Brazil (‚ÄúNEOgas‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) is a leading provider of off-pipeline natural gas solutions in Latin America. The Company is utilizing its own proprietary equipment design and technology and operates in Brazil, Peru, Mexico and Colombia where it supplies CNG by trailers in remote areas that are not serviced by the existing gas pipelines. The Company is seeking financing to fund its capital expenditure program that includes acquisition of additional new equipment to support growth in the markets where it currently operates.\n\n\n\nNEOgas is majority-owned (76%) by a fund sponsored by Global Environment Fund (‚ÄúGEF‚Äù), a private equity fund manager based in Washington, D.C. focused on investing in companies improving the natural environment. Minority shareholders include CleanTech, a private equity fund managed by Emerging Energy and Environment (‚ÄúEEE‚Äù), a Stamford, CT based private equity fund manager focused on clean energy investments in Latin America (8%); NPR Group, a Rio de Janeiro-based partnership for investments in energy businesses (8%); and Purbeck do Brasil & Adoble, investment vehicles for the original company founders (6%) represented by Antonio de Azevedo, currently Director for Brazil and Operations and members of his family.\n\n\n\nClimate change mitigation: NEOgas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas to areas where it is otherwise unavailable, resulting in the displacement of competing fuels such as fuel oil, gasoline and diesel, which are more polluting and with a much higher carbon impact per energy unit. \n\nImproved competitiveness of local companies located in frontier areas that are not serviced by the existing gas pipelines: NEOgas provides off-pipeline natural gas solutions to vehicular and industrial customers utilizing a proprietary technology that reduces capital and operational expenses to its customers: the average annual energy cost savings for industrial customers range from 40-60% depending on the location.\n\nJob creation: expansion of NEOgas operations will create quality employment opportunities in Peru, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.\n\n\n\nThe Project will be implemented at various locations in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.",

The CDTA will also enhance NMG s capacity in structuring PPPs for clean energy investments through appropriate allocation of responsibilities and risks between private and public sector entities. The CDTA will identify technologies and industrial processes to achieve the benchmark energy efficiency levels and assist NMG in establishing a technology transfer mechanism through technology providers, such as energy service companies (ESCOs). Since the ESCOs have the right technical expertise on appropriate technologies but are constrained by access to debt financing, the CDTA will be developing innovative financial products and instruments and recommend the establishment of a dedicated financing platform to mobilize financing for energy efficiency projects implemented by ESCOs and SMEs overcoming prevailing barriers. If successful, it can be introduced and replicated in other parts of the PRC. Integration of distributed renewable energy sources poses a number of technical, institutional, and financial challenges for investments to flow in scattered but large number of small-scale renewable energy projects compared to a single large-scale project. The role of private investments in such projects cannot be emphasized enough. The proposed CDTA will review the current policy framework to introduce appropriate policy incentives through transparent regulatory regime, feed-in tariffs, and tax incentives to promote private sector investments through PPPs in distributed renewable energy.",

   "ADB Project 47037-002.\n\n\n\nIn recent years Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) compared with 29% in 1990. But a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 54% in 2011 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not the solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix, especially from renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network also needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. Another challenge is to improve system reliability and cut technical losses. 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network is needed to expand power supply into rural areas, where many of the poor households remain unconnected or have poor quality of supplies. The new energy agenda also targets more clean energy. This is yet another means to ensure sector sustainability in the long term. Finally, the government intends to pursue financial, managerial, and institutional reforms, in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009. The government intends to pursue cost recovery and expects that with the introduction of low-cost coal-fired generation it will be possible to address the current high cost of power generation and achieve cost recovery from 2018. As part of its cost recovery strategy, the government increased retail electricity tariffs by 35% on average in April 2013. While the government aims to increase supply capacity and replace expensive and inefficient oil-fired power plants by constructing the coal-fired plants, the remaining supply capacity will need to come from renewable sources (and conversion of the oil-fired plants to gas-fired plants). The 20% increase in power generation from non-conventional renewable sources will be in addition to the current 45% of the conventional hydropower and will ensure that most of electricity will be generated by domestic clean energy sources in the future. This will address the critical question about the energy security agenda.",

The coverage to all guarantee holders is for a period of up to 12 years against the risk of breach of contract.\n\nThe project consists of the construction of an 83 megawatt heavy fuel oil plant on a build, own, and operate basis. The plant will be located at Kitengela, near the Athi River, approximately 25 kilometers from Nairobi. Triumph will enter into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company.\n\nThe World Bank‚Äôs Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic found that the lack of adequate, reliable electricity supply is Kenya‚Äôs largest infrastructure challenge and a key constraint to economic growth (contributing to economic losses of an estimated 2 percent of GDP). The project will help Kenya achieve a more diversified energy mix and stability to its power generation. The country remains heavily dependent on hydropower, which is frequently negatively impacted by drought. Installed thermal capacity provides a less expensive alternative to investments in emergency diesel-fired plants.\n\nThe project is further supported by a partial risk guarantee from the World Bank‚Äôs International Development Association that backstops a letter of credit from JP Morgan Bank of London.\n\nMIGA‚Äôs guarantees are aligned with the Agency‚Äôs strategy of supporting investments in countries eligible for lending from the International Development Association, investments in complex projects, and South-South investments.",

The coverage is for a period of 13 years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations.\n\nThe project involves the construction of a second powerhouse with four additional turbine generators with a total additional capacity of 700 megawatts on the basis of an engineering, procurement, and construction contract awarded to Odebrecht SA of Brazil. The Cambambe plant is one of two hydroelectric power stations currently in operation on the Kwanza River. The project is part of a larger rehabilitation and expansion program being undertaken by the government of Angola, under which the country‚Äôs generation capacity is set to increase from around 1,500 megawatts to over 5,000 megawatts.\n\nAfter decades of underinvestment into the power sector, Angola suffers from chronic electricity shortages that are hampering the country‚Äôs economic development. A recent government policy document, ‚ÄúPolicy and National Energy Security Strategy‚Äù estimated that only 30 percent of the population has access to the power distribution network.  Electricity from this project will offer an economic and efficient means of increasing the electricity supply. Rebuilding and improving critical infrastructure is a pillar of the World Bank‚Äôs strategy for Angola‚Äôs development. The project is also aligned with MIGA‚Äôs strategic priorities of supporting investments in complex infrastructure projects as well as in countries affected by conflict.",

Naryn cascade accounts for 97% of the hydro capacity and 78% of the total installed power generation capacity in the country. Toktogul HPP is the region's only multi-year storage capacity. Producing 50% of the average electricity output, the power plant plays a critical role as a domestic power source and as a power exporter and provider of frequency regulator services to the Central Asian power system (CAPS). CAPS comprises the synchronously interconnected systems of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. Tajikistan, previously connected to CAPS, is currently operating on an island mode. Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) Electric Power Plants (EPP), the state-owned generation company, wishes to implement the complete rehabilitation of the Toktogul HPP as recommended by the PPTA Study of Hydropower Plants on Naryn Cascade (PPTA Study for Phase 1). Toktogul HPP has been in service since 1975 with no significant rehabilitation or modernization work having been undertaken. Critical equipment is failing, resulting in availability dropping to 80%. It is considered that availability rates will continue to drop in the absence of rehabilitation. Phase 1 has been initiated covering critical secondary mechanical and electrical equipment that are becoming unreliable and unsafe to operate. The implementation consultant has been fielded. The contract award is expected by early 2014. In 2001, the state-owned utility was unbundled into one generation, one transmission, four electricity distribution companies, and one district heating company. This unbundled sector structure remains in effect today. Various privatization initiatives have been conducted with insignificant success following a negative social reaction. No new privatization initiatives of existing assets are planned in the medium term. Government policy is for new generation assets to be developed largely by the private sector while existing government-owned assets are rehabilitated by sovereign borrowing. The government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component of its development plan. The project is aligned with the government's and ADB's strategy to (i) focus on reliable power supply, (ii) improve sector financial and corporate management, (iii) increase energy security, and (iv) expand regional power exports. Both phase 2 and phase 3 projects will be included in ADB's country operation business plan 2014-2016. Phase 3 is programmed for 2016.",

The impact of the Project is to sustain the country's inclusive economic growth by promoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. Accelerating the development of hydropower for export is of strategic significance for Bhutan\u0019s economy. Given the Government\u0019s limited fiscal capacity for large infrastructure projects, the hydropower development strategy is to leverage public and private investments through private participation in development projects. This approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, and generate income for more socioeconomic development. To promote the country\u0019s strategy, the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) supported the Government in establishing a policy and institutional framework for public and private participation in hydropower development. The Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP facility in line with the Hydropower Development Policy, which is to promote private and foreign investments for hydropower generation in Bhutan. Further TA support will be provided to develop Government capacity for hydropower export.\n\n\n\n\"ADB Project 37399-043.\n\n\n\nThe Green Power Development Project was approved on 29 October 2008. It includes two components: (i) hydropower development and (ii) rural electrification. Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126 megawatt (MW) run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The second component provides access to electricity in rural areas for around 9,000 rural households and public facilities on an on-grid and off-grid basis using renewable energy sources (i.e., hydropower and solar power).¬†The proposed additional financing will ensure successful completion of Dagachhu hydropower development where the construction cost has overrun mainly due to unexpected geological conditions in the underground excavation works and their relevant price escalation. The project site is in the southwestern area of Bhutan around 50 km away from the cross-border of India.\n\n\"",

The subprojects are expected to have a loan repayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these subprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects through the REF.\n\n\n\nThe PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which provided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010. The Government of the PRC has recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated emissions. It has committed to achieve 40% 45% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared with 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions. During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006 2010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011 2015, has set a target of a further 16% energy intensity reduction. More than three fourths of the PRC s electricity and about half of its primary energy are consumed by the industrial sector. The 1,000 Key Enterprises Program was launched during the Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about two-thirds of the total industrial energy consumption. During the Twelfth plan, the ongoing program will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of 10,000 tons of coal equivalent (tce) and higher.

Enhanced capacity for application of environmental and social safeguards standards 5. Enhanced efficiency of IDCOL in developing and financing infrastructure subprojects\n\n\n\n(iii) promote renewable energy systems (RESs) by financing the set-up of RES such as solar home system (SHS) and other renewable energy applications such as biomass and gas installations (component C). One of the main aspects of Component C is to help provide access to environment-friendly electricity for rural population in off-grid areas by financing the set-up of RESs such as SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program, and biomass and gas installations under the lead of IDCOL. The proposed change concerns providing additional grant funding for component C of the Project for financing RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate Change Fund in parallel with the processing of the Project. However, the application process for both funds was only partially finalized by the time the Project was approved by ADB's Board on 2 October 2008. As a consequence, the grant financing will be processed as supplementary financing to be allocated to the Project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the Project will be funded from the following sources, namely: (i) Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB; and (ii) Grant of $1,300,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund. The proposed supplementary grant will complement the ADF funding of $33 million equivalent under component C of the Project. The $2 million allocation under the CEFPF will be used to provide a $25 buy-down grant per individual SHS. This will enable 80,000 low- and middle-income households and micro and small enterprises in IDCOL's solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. While loan financing under component C of the Project is exhausted to a large extent, the proposed supplementary financing will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors. Furthermore, the $1.3 million grant under CCF will provide IDCOL with a total available subsidy amount of $580,000 for the financing of up to 50% of total cost of other renewable energy applications such as biomass and biogas installations in rural areas with no access to grid electricity. The remaining grant amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for expenses related to the administration and monitoring of the renewable energy program such as: (i) $357,000 as program support administration cost of IDCOL for the management and monitoring on the use of the refinancing loans and grant component); (ii) $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of PO staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. Thanks to the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets maintenance, services and spare parts are available in reasonable vicinity of the SHSs customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is around 10 kilometers; (iii) $30,000 earmarked to carry out technical inspections; (iv) $60,000 for annual technical audits carried out by an audit firm for 2 consecutive years; and (v) $40,000 for appointing independent engineers to conduct feasibility studies, appraise and monitor renewable energy projects.\n\n\n\nADB Project 42180-013.\n\n\n\nThe proposed Second Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II or the Project). PPIDF II will build on the efforts of Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF I) in helping address the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh by providing long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through IDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and increase in employment opportunities. The design of the Project serves to attract commercial financing for infrastructure projects, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget. An additional objective of the Project is to help provide the rural population and small to medium enterprises in off-grid areas with access to environment-friendly electricity. The proposed financing modalities of the Project. PPIDF II comprises two components, namely: (i) component 1 which will use the proceeds from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) sovereign loan up to $100 million to provide IDCOL with long-term additional resources for the financing of medium to large-sized private sector-led infrastructure projects with a total project cost of minimum $10 million; and (ii) component 2 which will route the proceeds from the sovereign Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of up to $10 million through IDCOL for the further expansion of its successful SHS program which has so far provided financing of more than 2 million SHS through a microfinance-based, direct sales program in rural off-grid areas to provide households and small businesses with a renewable source of energy. Component 1 will provide funding directly to subborrowers in form of providing long-term loans to infrastructure project while component 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating organizations (POs) to the end-user which are typically households in off-grid areas.",

Investment requirements, excluding various intra-state requirements, total about $4.2 billion. The investments to be funded with the proposed ADB loan have a total project cost of about $1 billion, for which it is proposed that ADB provide a $500 million loan. The ADB loan envisages green energy corridor components, including two 765 kV direct current lines , a 3000 MVA 765/400 kV substation at Suratgarh, and associated reactive compensation , plus upgradation of an existing high voltage direct current corridor , and increased interconnectivity between the western and southern regions. An additional component includes investments in static compensators to improve grid stability in response to previous grid disturbance in northern India. The proposed ADB loan will thus improve interstate power flows and system reliability, so that the overall system is more accommodating to the growing intermittent renewable energy sources under development and the possibility of the future development of renewable energy sources by both public and private sector will be enhanced in India.\n\n\n\nProject Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy\n\n\n\nThe Indian power sector has a history of steadily increasing demand for, and chronic shortages of, electricity. An adequate power supply contributes to poverty alleviation, yet over 30% of India s population lack access to electricity. Continued shortages significantly constrain commercial and industrial activity and reduce growth. Businesses and manufacturers must utilize more expensive back-up power supplies, often diesel fuel-based, which increase their costs, undercut competitiveness and contributes to unwanted GHG emissions. Insufficient domestic fuel resources and rising international coal and oil prices threaten India s already fragile energy security, such that maximizing renewable energy sources is a government priority. Presently the total installed electricity generation capacity in India is about 228.7 giga-watt (GW) as of 30 September 2013. Out of this, about 13% (29 GW) is from renewable energy sources. During India s 12th Five Year Plan (2013-2017), the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) targets an additional 32 GW of renewable energy generation capacity from wind, solar, small hydropower and biomass sources, more than doubling the existing capacity. However, the intermittent nature of these renewable energy sources threatens transmission grid stability, such that considerable new transmission system investment is required to effectively evacuate renewable power from its source locations to the grid, and to perform system balancing functions. MNRE and the Forum of Regulators commissioned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (Powergrid) to conduct a study to identify requisite nationwide transmission investments required to accommodate the anticipated additional renewable energy generation capacity. Powergrid is the public sector corporation that is mainly responsible for construction, expansion, operations and maintenance of India s inter-state and inter-regional power transmission network.\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n(for ensuing project) Enhanced transmission system capacity to absorb large renewable energy capacity additions.",
