<h1>About</h1>

<h2>International</h2>

<p>The <b>Shift the Subsidies - International</b> database is an interactive tool to visually track and analyze the flow of energy subsidies from international, regional and bilateral public financial institutions around the world.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>For decades, wealthy countries and private companies have been using international aid and other foreign assistance—through grants, loans, equity and loan guarantees—to subsidize the expansion of the global fossil fuel industry.</p>

<p>International financial institutions such as the World Bank Group and regional development banks, along with export credit agencies and bilateral aid agencies, provide tens of billions of dollars each year in direct financial support to oil, gas and coal companies to expand production globally. This dirty energy infrastructure causes local pollution, relocation of communities, and contributes to climate change - which is expected to hit developing countries and the poor hardest - and rarely supports increased access to energy for the poor.</p>

<p>As the threat of climate change increases and recognition of the benefits of basic energy services for the world’s poorest grows, some aid money and even some money from export credit agencies has begun to shift toward cleaner modes of energy production and to increase access to energy for the world's poorest people. But a great deal of public money continues to flow to large-scale fossil fuel development and even oil, gas and coal exploration projects that seek to add to the world’s fossil fuel resources – although climate science now tells us that we can only burn a small portion of already proven fossil fuel reserves.</p>

<p>By tracking energy subsidies, this database is designed to arm you with information on the quantity, sources, and types of energy subsidies in order to encourage development banks and other public finance institutions to Shift the Subsidies from dirty to clean energy.</p>

<h3>Who is responsible for the database?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.priceofoil.org">Oil Change International</a> is responsible for the development and maintenance of the Shift the Subsidies database.</p>

<p>We also thank <a href="http://bankwatch.org">CEE Bankwatch Network</a> for contributing data on the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the <a href="http://bicusa.org">Bank Information Center</a> for some data on the World Bank Group, and <a href="http://nrdc.org">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> for bilateral coal financing data.</p>

<p><a href="http://staydiligent.com/">Diligent Creative</a> designed and developed the Shift the Subsidies database and website.</p>

<h3>What data is included in the database?</h3>

<p>The Shift the Subsidies database currently tracks energy financing for projects, policies, technical assistance, and financial intermediary projects – where possible – supported by the following institutions from fiscal years 2008 to 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>the World Bank Group, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)</li>
<li>regional development banks, including African Development Bank (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</li>
<li>U.S. bilateral finance, including U.S. Export Import Bank and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation</li>
<li>Japanese bilateral finance, including Japan Bank for International Cooperation with other Japanese bilateral finance forthcoming</li>
<li>bilateral finance for coal projects</li>
</ul>

<p>We are in the process of adding bilateral financing from additional G20 governments. Each project is classified by energy source (each of which is labeled fossil fuel, clean, or other), and evaluated for whether it specifically targets energy access for the poor.</p>

<p>The International data is displayed on the website through three main screens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regions: This screen shows countries shaded by the ratio of clean vs. fossil fuel energy loans, guarantees, equity, and grants received from international, regional, and bilateral public institutions</li>
<li>Institutions: This screen shows international, regional, and bilateral public institutions scaled by total award of grants, loans, equity, and loan guarantees and shaded by their clean vs fossil fuel energy portfolio.</li>
<li>Sectors: This screen shows energy sectors scaled by total receipt of grants, loans, equity, and loan guarantees from international, regional, and bilateral public institutions and shaded by their clean vs fossil fuel status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How is the data compiled?</h3>

<h2>National</h2>

<p>The <b>Shift the Subsidies - National</b> database is an interactive tool to visually track and analyze the amount of public money at the national and subnational levels supporting oil, gas and coal development.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Every year, some $775 billion or more in subsidies around the world go towards supporting fossil fuels. In a time of economic hardship, dangerous climate change, and growing demand for reliable and cleaner sources of energy, these fossil fuel subsidies are a reckless and irrational use of taxpayer money and government investments.</p>

<p>In part recognizing this fact, global leaders from over 50 countries have made public commitments to phase out these subsidies in the “medium term”… but as with many commitments political leaders make, these have gone unfulfilled. Governments are busy hiding their subsidies and feigning activity, while billions of dollars are wasted, the atmosphere gets filled with greenhouse gas emissions and the planet burns.</p>

<p>The most egregious of these subsidies are production and exploration subsidies - those subsidies that pour more money into expanding already lucrative industries that thrive on further polluting our planet. According to the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others, more than two-thirds of currently proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground in order to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Given this increasingly scientifically-accepted reality, continuing to put public money into the expansion of the oil, gas and coal industries is unpardonable.</p>

<p>By tracking subsidies to oil, gas and coal at the national level, this database is designed to arm you with information to encourage national, state, and provincial governments to Shift the Subsidies from dirty to clean energy.</p>

<h3>Who is responsible for the database?</h3>

<p><a href="http://priceofoil.org/">Oil Change International</a> is responsible for the development and maintenance of the Shift the Subsidies database. <a href="http://staydiligent.com/">Diligent Creative</a> designed and developed the Shift the Subsidies database and website.</p>

<h2>What data is included in the database?</h2>

<p>The information included in the Shift the Subsidies - National database currently relies heavily on oil, gas and coal subsidy information from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/env/fossilfuelsubsidies.htm">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</a>, which tracks fossil fuel subsidies in 34 countries.</p>

<p>Using the data available from the OECD, Oil Change International has reviewed the subsidies, sometimes reclassifying them to showcase exploration, production and consumption subsidies, and converting the subsidy amounts provided to U.S. dollars. If currency conversion is required, the U.S. dollar amount is calculated based on the exchange rate on December 31 of the approval year, using the rates published on <a href="http://www.x-rates.com/historical/">X-Rates</a>.</p>

<p>Oil Change International has further reviewed and added data from additional sources in several key countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States: Oil Change has completed additional research on U.S. fossil fuel subsidies, and various sources have been added to the OECD data.</li>
<li>Indonesia: Oil Change has completed original research on coal subsidies in Indonesia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further research on fossil fuel subsidies exploration and production in G20 countries is forthcoming. Additional coal subsidies data is also forthcoming for Turkey and South Africa.</p>
<p>The National data is displayed on a map showing countries shaded by scale of total tax credits, incentives and other types of support provided by the national government to oil, gas and coal.

	<h1>Methodology <small>(International)</small></h1>

	<h2>How are projects classified as ‘Fossil’, ‘Clean’, or 'Other'?</h2>

	<p>Each project is classified into a category and sector as outlined below, based on the description of the project and project documents. A description of each category can be found by clicking on the sector under the ‘Energy Sectors’ tab.</p>
	<p><b>Fossil Fuel</b>. Fossil fuels include any oil, gas or coal production or exploration projects, or projects supporting the development or transmission of fossil fuel power. It also includes any policy reforms that provide incentives for fossil fuel development and investment.</p>
	<p><b>Clean Energy</b>. Projects classified as clean energy include energy sources that are both low carbon and have low impacts on the local environment and on human populations. Some energy efficiency and some renewable energy—energy coming from naturally replenished resources such as the sun, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal energy, is included as 'Clean' energy. It also includes any policy reforms that provide incentives for clean energy development and investment.</p>
	<p><b>Other</b>. The development of some 'renewable' sources — notably large hydropower, biofuels, and biomass — can have significant impacts on the local environment and on human populations that make it difficult to consider them totally 'clean.' These energy sources, along with nuclear power, incineration, and other forms of power that are not fossil fuel but not 'clean,' are included in the 'Other' category. Many transmission/distribution and energy sector policy reforms that are unable to be specifically linked to the source of energy are also classified as “other”.</p>
	<p>Go to our <a href="#sectors">Energy Sectors</a> page to see all of the energy sectors included in the database and how they are grouped as fossil (black), clean (green), or other (gray).</p>

	<h2>When is a project classified as energy access for the poor?</h2>

	<p>Project descriptions and documents are evaluated to determine whether or not the project targets increased energy access for the poor. The following indicators are verified in project documents to evaluate whether projects address energy access for the poor:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The project focuses on a targeted number of new electricity connections or energy services, such as clean cook stoves, to low-income households.</li>
		<li>The project focuses on electricity for services important to the poor, such as health clinics, schools, or telecommunications.</li>
		<li>The project focuses on improving the reliability of electricity services in an area that largely serves low-income households and/or electricity services important to the poor and currently has intermittent or unreliable access.</li>
		<li>The project focuses on provisions to make energy affordable for the poor e.g., effective, transparent safety nets to ensure that poor people can afford energy for basic needs, such as subsidies targeted at access, not consumption (as opposed to only having measures aimed at cost recovery, such as tariff increases).</li>
		<li>The project is focused on productive uses in energy poor communities, such as providing energy to smallholder farmers, small and medium enterprises and labor-intensive industries.</li>
		<li>The project involves power grid extension to new peri-urban or rural areas (as opposed to simply feeding into the existing grid system).</li>
		<li>The project involves rural, off-grid solutions for providing energy services.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>How is the ‘subsidy’ amount determined?</h2>

	<p>The 'subsidy' amount is the amount committed from the financial institution on the date that the loan, grant, or guarantee was approved by the institution. If it can be determined from project information that only a portion of the project or loan went to energy, then only that percentage will be included as the ‘subsidy’ amount.</p>

	<p>The amount is entered in U.S. dollars. If currency conversion is required, the U.S. dollar amount is calculated based on the exchange rate on December 31 of the approval year, using the rates published on <a href="http://www.x-rates.com/historical/">X-Rates</a>.</p>

	<p>We recognize that there are different ways of quantifying subsidies. For example, some might argue that a 'subsidy' from a development bank should only reflect the difference in the below market interest rate and the subsidized interest rate for the project loan amount. However, most financing institutions do not make publicly available the financing terms, interest rates, or other details about financial transactions, so determining the favorable financing terms for each project is extremely difficult. In addition, in some cases, the energy project would not be able to obtain adequate finance without the public assistance and would thus not go forward at all. This simply illustrates the difficulty in quantifying the subsidy.</p>

	<p>By tracking the overall amount of international financial institution and bilateral financing going to entities for energy projects, the database accurately reflects trends in the types of energy being supported with public money.</p>

	<h1>Methodology <small>(National)</small></h1>

	<p>The National Subsidy database relies heavily on data available from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/env/fossilfuelsubsidies.htm">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</a>. Oil Change International has reviewed the subsidies, sometimes reclassifying them to showcase exploration, production and consumption subsidies, and converting the subsidy amounts provided to U.S. dollars.  If currency conversion is required, the U.S. dollar amount is calculated based on the exchange rate on December 31 of the approval year, using the rates published on <a href="http://www.x-rates.com/historical/">X-Rates</a>.</p>

	<p>In addition, subsidies in G20 countries that are specifically related to exploration for additional fossil fuel reserves are being added to the database. In addition to OECD data, supplemental information on exploration subsidies is drawn from official budget documents, government reports, and other independent subsidy studies.</p>

<h1>Exploration Subsidies</h1>

	<p>Exploration subsidies support the discovery and expansion of additional oil, gas, and coal reserves. Many countries have national subsidies that directly support fossil fuel exploration activities, such as tax deductions for exploration expenses and direct funding by government agencies to conduct seismic tests and exploratory drilling to identify new fossil fuel reserves. Additional subsidies aimed at incentivizing fossil fuel production such as deductions for drilling and investment costs, also largely benefit exploration activities. Most of the major multilateral development banks and bilateral finance and development agencies provide favorable financing – a form of subsidization – to fossil fuel exploration projects around the world.</p>

	<p>At the same time that countries are subsidizing the search for additional fossil fuel resources, scientists are sounding the alarm that we must keep the majority of known reserves in the ground. In 2012, the <a href="http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/publications/weo-2012/">International Energy Agency (IEA) warned</a> that “no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2°C goal,” the maximum level of warming to which governments have committed in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. Reserves that must be left unused are known as <a href="http://www.carbontracker.org/site/unburnable-carbon">“unburnable carbon”</a>.</p>

	<p>As governments around the world have failed to introduce policies to achieve the necessary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, the amount of fossil fuels that we can still burn and stay within climate targets – the “carbon budget” – is quickly shrinking, just as fossil fuel reserves are continuing to grow.</p>

	<p>The window for achieving global climate goals is rapidly closing. Governments should stop encouraging exploration for new fossil fuel reserves in order to stop masking the true cost and risk of more oil, gas and coal. Governments should therefore target exploration subsidies for immediate elimination in order to live up to global pledges for climate action and fossil fuel subsidy reform.</p>
